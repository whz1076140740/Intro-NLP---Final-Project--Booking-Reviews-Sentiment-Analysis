So I didn't listen :( Warning also on the fact that in addition to the 33 ‚Ç¨ of the visit you have to reserve additional access to be able to climb the towers... offer which was not made to me on the site when I booked. So, yes it's beautiful, but no, the experience was not optimal.\n",

De man zei ons dat we rond het park moesten gaan om naar het meeting punt te gaan van Julua Travel. Maar we zouden er sowieso te laat aankomen en ons geld zou verloren zijn. Als we te lang zouden wachten zouden alle tickets voor het park uitverkocht zijn. Na eerst proberen telefonisch contact op te nemen met booking.com en met Julia travel hebben we de gewone ingangstickets ook gekocht zodat we het park konden bezoeken op de laatste dag waarop mijn zoon erbij was. Iedereen van Parc Guel die we aanspraken was zeer bot en vaak onbeleefd. Na het bezoek hebben e in het meeting punt van Jula travel gevraagd of we konden omboeken naar iets anders. Dat kon niet. We hebben dan gebeld met iemand van het kantoor van Jula travel die letterlijk zei dat ze maar √©√©n excursie hadden in Barcelona. Als we niet opnieuw Parc Guel wouden bezoeken moesten we een mail¬¥sturen met vraag refund maar dit was hoogst onwaarschijnlijk. Ik stuurde mail met vraag tot omboeken tot een aantal attracties die ik op de site van Julia travel vond. Of refund. Antwoord: u moet zich tot booking.com richten. Dit heb ik gedaan maar geen antwoord ontvangen.\n",

      "Text: Wir sind mit vier Kindern zwischen 5 Monaten und 9 Jahren gereist. Positiv empfanden wir die Atmosph√§re, man taucht ab in eine andere Welt. Ja Disney l√§sst es bei 7 Grad plus aus heiterem Himmel schneien und spielt Let it snow dazu. Ja es ist magisch, es zieht einen in seinen Bann und man ist gefesselt. Riesige, pomp√∂s geschm√ºckte Weihnachtsb√§ume. Atemberaubende Shows und Lichteffekte. Achterbahnen, die f√ºr Nervenkitzel sorgen..... Disney Figuren sehen.... Das ist der Grund warum wir da waren, unsere Kinder haben diese Atmosph√§re genossen. Zu Beginn waren unsere Tickets √ºber die App nicht mehr abrufbar, daf√ºr ein Minuspunkt von unserer Seite aus. Booking konnte das Problem aber l√∂sen, wenn auch mit langer Zeit (2h) und ewigen Telefonaten in verschiedenen Sprachen. Nun zur Kritik am Park : Sehen wir uns den Park unter dem Gesichtspunkt der Zielgruppe Kinder an : - kein Familien Check in, sowohl bei der Sicherheitskontrolle als auch im Park. Jeder geht √ºberall durch, null Organisation. Am Rollstuhl / Kinderwageneingang zig Menschen, weder Rollstuhl noch Kinderwagen. - Der Park ist in die Jahre gekommen, Farbe bl√§ttert ab, Attraktionen zb Buzz aus den 90er Wenig aktuelles zb Frozen, Miraculous etc - Wartezeiten selbst um Mickey zu treffen 60 Minuten ( Fast Pass m√∂glich kostet so viel wie der Eintritt) - selbst an den Toiletten und Restaurants ewiges Warten - gr√∂√üter Minuspunkt : wir waren beim Essen und ich wollte mich mit den Kindern an einem Tisch setzen w√§hrend mein Mann essen holt und unseren kleinsten kurz stillen Das Personal hat uns das verwehrt, anstatt dessen sollten wir mit 4 Kindern und wagen in die Schlange f√ºrs Essen stehen oder raus gehen zum Stillen Als wir dann essen hatten durften wir uns mit bier Kindern, einem Kinderwagen und 4 Tabletts voller essen einen freien Platz suchen.... Da h√§tte ich mehr Organisation erwartet - Preise... Ja es ist Disney und ja es ist magisch. Aber fast zweistellig f√ºr ne kleine Packung Popcorn? Der Fast Pass so viel wie der Eintritt? Mal abgesehen von essen, trinken und Souvenirs Unser Fazit : kann man mal machen, aber sollte man sich gut √ºberlegen ob einem das Geld das wert ist\n",

The staff refused to let us do that, instead we were supposed to dare with 4 children stand in line for food or go out to breastfeed. When we had eaten we were allowed to look for a free place with our children, a stroller and 4 trays full of food.... I would have expected more organization - prices...

      "Text: Vendredi 13h, les rires et l‚Äôenthousiasme de mes enfants emplissent la voiture. Plus particuli√®rement mon fils qui adore flash McQueen, le roi lion et Spiderman. Lui, le bienheureux qui n‚Äôest pas encore outill√© pour en faire une analyse sociopolitique, attendait depuis une semaine d‚Äô√©ternit√© ce cadeau de No√´l/ St Nicolas. Apr√®s les avoirs pris plus t√¥t √† l‚Äô√©cole, nous part√Æmes donc pour Disneyland Paris, o√π chaque coin est cens√© incarner la magie et l'√©merveillement. Pour eux, c'est un monde de r√™ve ; pour moi, parent, c'est l'occasion- pensais je- de leur offrir un moment inoubliable. Inoubliable pour eux mais aussi pour moi quand mon ≈ìil plus ou moins averti lorgne sur les coulisses de cette utopie de papier mach√©. Samedi matin, nous sommes accueillis par l'iconique ch√¢teau, symbole d'une perfection fantasm√©e. Les personnages de conte de f√©es, les attractions √©tincelantes, tout semble sorti d'un r√™ve jusque les bulles de savons qui nous tombent dessus par milliers. Mais au-del√† de l'√©clat, je commence √† percevoir les nuances moins reluisantes de ce tableau clair obscure. Le tourisme de masse √† Disneyland Paris se manifeste de fa√ßon palpable. Les longues files d'attente, la foule compacte, le rythme effr√©n√© ‚Äì tout cela r√©v√®le une r√©alit√© o√π le r√™ve est consomm√© en masse. Chaque \"land\" est une r√©plique d√©shistoris√©e, et d√©politis√©e de diff√©rents coins du monde ou de diff√©rents univers, pr√©sent√©s de mani√®re d√©vitalis√©e et st√©r√©otyp√©e. Chaque \"land\" pr√©sente ainsi une version √©dulcor√©e et souvent st√©r√©otyp√©e de diff√©rentes r√©gions et √©poques. Par exemple, Adventureland semble r√©duire l'Afrique et l'Asie √† un ensemble de clich√©s exotiques. De m√™me, Frontierland √©voque l'Ouest am√©ricain d'une mani√®re qui occulte les r√©alit√©s historiques douloureuses, notamment la colonisation et l'oppression des peuples autochtones. Difficile par ailleurs de ne pas √™tre conscient de la fa√ßon dont l'espace lui-m√™me est organis√©. Les hi√©rarchies spatiales √† Disneyland refl√®tent et reproduisent des hi√©rarchies sociales. Les espaces centraux sont consacr√©s aux r√©cits dominants et universellement reconnus, tandis que les p√©riph√©ries accueillent des r√©cits plus diversifi√©s, mais souvent simplifi√©s et exotis√©s. Cette disposition spatiale n'est pas fortuite, mais refl√®te des choix d√©lib√©r√©s qui privil√©gient certaines histoires et exp√©riences par rapport √† d'autres. En d√©ambulant, je suis en outre frapp√© par l'omnipr√©sence de la consommation. Chaque attraction, chaque spectacle, chaque m√®tre carr√© est con√ßu pour maximiser les d√©penses, transformant l'exp√©rience en une succession d'achats. Disneyland n'est pas (seulement) un parc d'attractions, c'est un centre commercial g√©ant d√©guis√© en terre de f√©erie. La nature, quant √† elle, est soigneusement contr√¥l√©e et mise en sc√®ne. Chaque arbre, chaque parterre de fleurs est m√©ticuleusement entretenu pour cr√©er l'illusion d'une nature parfaite, loin de sa forme sauvage et impr√©visible. Cela me rappelle √† quel point notre rapport √† l'environnement est souvent bas√© sur le contr√¥le et l'esth√©tique, au lieu de l'appr√©ciation de sa forme brute et naturelle. Et que dire des employ√©s ? Derri√®re leurs costumes et leurs sourires se cache une r√©alit√© de travail rigoureux, souvent peu valoris√©. Leur r√¥le est de perp√©tuer l'illusion d'un monde parfait, mais quel est le co√ªt personnel et professionnel de ce d√©cor humain ? En quittant le parc, je sens en moi comme un conflit. Mes enfants emportent avec eux des ¬´ souvenirs magiques ¬ª, mais pour moi, ce week-end a √©t√© un empreint de reflexions sur la complexit√© de notre qu√™te de perfection et de bonheur, notamment parental. Disneyland Paris, dans sa tentative de cr√©er une utopie, refl√®te les paradoxes de notre soci√©t√© : la recherche d'un monde id√©al tout en naviguant dans les r√©alit√©s du tourisme de masse, de la consommation excessive, des limites plan√©taires et d'une repr√©sentation hyper simplifi√©e du monde. Cette exp√©rience a renouvel√© la conscience que j‚Äôai de l'importance de chercher l'√©quilibre entre la magie des r√™ves et la prise en compte de la r√©alit√© dans toute sa complexit√©. Peut-√™tre est-il temps de red√©finir notre conception de l'utopie, en y int√©grant une conscience plus aigu√´ de notre impact sur le monde et sur les autres. De retour chez moi, la question d‚Äôun tourisme coh√©rent avec la d√©marche low tech et le respect des limites plan√©taires s'impose √† moi comme une √©vidence. Mon prochain voyage sera l‚Äôoccasion d‚Äôune d√©couverte respectueuse des traditions, de l'artisanat, de la gastronomie et des modes de vie locaux. Je contribuerai alors √† une √©conomie plus √©quitable, en soutenant les petits commer√ßants et artisans. Nos activit√©s touristiques incluraient des exp√©riences d'apprentissage sur l'environnement, la biodiversit√© locale, et les d√©fis √©cologiques, les pratiques low tech. Plut√¥t que de chercher constamment √† consommer et √† √™tre divertis, nous prendrons le temps d‚Äôappr√©cier la beaut√© et la tranquillit√© des paysages naturels, de nous reconnecter avec nous-m√™mes et avec la nature. Loin de la surstimulation des grands parcs nous privil√©gierons la satisfaction d‚Äôun besoin l√©gitime de d√©connection du quotidien et la reconnexion avec nos proches. En favorisant ces interactions authentiques et ces moments de partage, un tourisme local low tech ne serait pas seulement une mani√®re plus soutenable de voyager, mais aussi une opportunit√© pr√©cieuse de renforcer les liens familiaux et amicaux. Il s'agirait de c√©l√©brer la richesse de nos relations humaines et de reconna√Ætre que, dans un monde de plus en plus connect√©, la v√©ritable connexion se trouve souvent dans la simplicit√© des moments partag√©s.\n",

Unforgettable for them but also for me when my more or less informed eye peers behind the scenes of this papier-m√¢ch√© utopia. Saturday morning, we are welcomed by the iconic castle, a symbol of fantasy perfection. The fairytale characters, the sparkling attractions, everything seems out of a dream, even the soap bubbles that fall on us by the thousands. But beyond the brilliance, I begin to perceive the less brilliant nuances of this chiaroscuro picture. Mass tourism at Disneyland Paris is palpably evident. The long queues, the compact crowds, the frenetic pace ‚Äì all this reveals a reality where the dream is consumed en masse. Each ‚Äúland‚Äù is a dehistoricized and depoliticized replica of different corners of the world or different universes, presented in a devitalized and stereotypical manner. Each ‚Äúland‚Äù thus presents a watered-down and often stereotypical version of different regions and eras. For example, Adventureland seems to reduce Africa and Asia to a set of exotic clich√©s. Likewise, Frontierland evokes the American West in a way that obscures painful historical realities, including colonization and the oppression of indigenous peoples. It is also difficult not to be aware of the way in which the space itself is organized. Spatial hierarchies at Disneyland reflect and reproduce social hierarchies. The central spaces are devoted to dominant and universally recognized narratives, while the peripheries accommodate more diverse, but often simplified and exoticized, narratives. This spatial arrangement is not accidental, but reflects deliberate choices that privilege certain stories and experiences over others. As I wander around, I am further struck by the omnipresence of consumption. Every attraction, every show, every square meter is designed to maximize spending, transforming the experience into a succession of purchases. Disneyland is not (just) an amusement park, it is a giant shopping center disguised as a fairyland. Nature, for its part, is carefully controlled and staged. Each tree, each flower bed is meticulously maintained to create the illusion of perfect nature, far from its wild and unpredictable form. It reminds me how our relationship with the environment is often based on control and aesthetics, instead of appreciation of its raw, natural form. And what about the employees? Behind their costumes and their smiles hides a reality of rigorous work, often little valued. Their role is to perpetuate the illusion of a perfect world, but what is the personal and professional cost of this human setting? As I leave the park, I feel a conflict within me. My children take ‚Äúmagical memories‚Äù with them, but for me, this weekend was full of reflections on the complexity of our quest for perfection and happiness, particularly as a parent. Disneyland Paris, in its attempt to create a utopia, reflects the paradoxes of our society: the search for an ideal world while navigating the realities of mass tourism, excessive consumption, planetary limits and hyper representation. simplified world. This experience renewed my awareness of the importance of seeking a balance between the magic of dreams and taking into account reality in all its complexity. Perhaps it is time to redefine our conception of utopia, incorporating a more acute awareness of our impact on the world and on others. Back home, the question of tourism consistent with the low-tech approach and respect for planetary limits becomes obvious to me. My next trip will be an opportunity for a respectful discovery of local traditions, crafts, gastronomy and lifestyles. I will then contribute to a fairer economy, by supporting small traders and artisans. Our tourism activities would include learning experiences about the environment, local biodiversity, and ecological challenges, low tech practices. Rather than constantly seeking to consume and be entertained, we will take the time to appreciate the beauty and tranquility of natural landscapes, to reconnect with ourselves and with nature. Far from the overstimulation of large parks, we will prioritize satisfying a legitimate need to disconnect from everyday life and reconnect with our loved ones. By promoting these authentic interactions and moments of sharing, low-tech local tourism would not only be a more sustainable way to travel, but also a valuable opportunity to strengthen family and friendly ties. It would be about celebrating the richness of our human relationships and recognizing that, in an increasingly connected world, true connection is often found in the simplicity of shared moments., pronunciation=[[]], extra_data=\"{'translat...\")\n",
      "Translated: Friday 1 p.m., the laughter and enthusiasm of my children fill the car. Especially my son who loves Lightning McQueen, The Lion King and Spiderman.

      "Text: Prenotato il 30 agosto presso Booking.com i due biglietti per il 18 settembre. Ricevuta conferma di prenotazione , stampata e nel dubbio sul cellulare . Arrivati a Disneyland‚Ä¶ facciamo la prima fila di 15/20 minuti . Superato il controllo sicurezza ‚Ä¶ seconda fila sempre di 15/20 minuti. Al nostro turno , i nostri ‚Äú biglietti ‚Äú non ci fanno passare e dopo aver tentato in tutti i modi , una inserviente ci dice che non sono attivi e quindi dovremo andare da un‚Äôaltra entrata per fare attivare / verificare i biglietti . Altra cosa di disperati come noi di 30 minuti. Al nostro turno , la fortuna ci aiuta e il ragazzo al nostro sportello di origine italiana , dopo averci spiegato che avremmo dovuto ricevere una sorte di conferma da chi avevamo prenotato. Segue riga di domande ‚Ä¶ quando avete fatto la prenotazione ? Siete sicuri che la risposta non sia andata nelle Spam..? Mi faccia vedere il suo cellulare ‚Ä¶. Ma nel suo sito o profilo di Booking.com non risulta nessuna prenotazione ‚Ä¶ pur avendo il foglio di conferma !!! Allora chiama altri due colleghi che lasciano le loro postazioni e si mettono a smanettare sulla tastiera , con domande alle quali non sapevo pi√π cosa cercare o rispondere. Dopo 20/25 minuti ed una fila che rumoreggiava ed aumentava a vista d‚Äôocchio‚Ä¶ un ‚Äú forse abbiamo trovato ‚Äú. Mi stampano i due famosi biglietti . Rifacciamo la coda d‚Äôingresso 15/20 minuti a Disneyland entrata meravigliosa con il castello e c‚Äô√® subito una sfilata di carri con musica e migliaia di persone in coda e un po‚Äô tartassate con bimbi , carrozzine , famigliole e un sacco di adulti come noi. Finita la sfilata dei personaggi dei film , possiamo finalmente iniziare a cercare le famose attrazioni che ci erano state consigliate o avevo letto da non perdere‚Ä¶. Space montain ( credo si chiami cos√¨ ) ‚Ä¶. Chiuso per manutenzione ..ü´£. Poi facciamo l√¨ accanto la prima coda , la pi√π breve ! Di 30 minuti per poi scoprire che l‚Äôattrazione consisteva nel farsi fotografare con Dark ‚Ä¶. Non so ‚Ä¶. Personaggio cattivo di Guerra Stellari üòµ‚Ä¶. Giriamo ancora in lungo ed in largo. Ma solo cose da bambini piccoli √® pieno di adulti disorientati e stanchi del girare inutilmente o dalle code che vanno da 45 a 60 minuti di fila . Guardando la cartina vediamo che accanto ci sono le attrazioni pi√π adatte agli adulti . Puntiamo decisi e una volta arrivati all‚Äôingresso , ci dicono che non possiamo entrare con il biglietto perch√© valeva solo per uno dei due ‚Ä¶.. Disneyland o Studios‚Ä¶. Certo uno che √® alla ennesima volta che va, ma per noi che che eravamo alla prima ( e assolutamente ultima ) volta ‚Ä¶. Io vado a Disneyland‚Ä¶ come se vado a Gardaland ‚Ä¶ entro dove c‚Äô√® Disneyland‚Ä¶. A 56 euro a testa oltretutto üòµ. Quindi con tante ore di file inutili e tanta rabbia , decidiamo di tornare a Parigi. Il ridicolo totale ( ed il perch√© di questo mio sfogo ) mi arriva da voi Booking.com la domanda‚Ä¶ com‚Äô√® andata la giornata a Disneyland? Ma allora lo sapevate che avevamo prenotato presso di voi‚Ä¶. Ma non c‚Äô√® stato modo di risalire alla prenotazione. E poi ho rifatto tutta la simulazione della prenotazione e in nessun caso , anche sul sito di Disneyland.com , nessuna specificazione o suggerimento sul fatto che da una zona ci dovrebbero andare prevalentemente le famiglie con bimbi‚Ä¶ e gli Studios che sono preposti ad un pubblico pi√π adulto e non adatto a bambini piccoli che non potrebbero fare quasi nessuna delle attrazioni . √à la prima volta che faccio una recensione cos√¨ negativa ‚Ä¶. Ma una giornata buttata ed oltretutto tra biglietti , viaggi andata e ritorno a Parigi, pi√π pause cibi e un sandwich‚Ä¶.un bel 230 euro üí∂ regalate ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n",

We were not the only ones considering the line that had to go through the check-in desk again for inspection at 12 o'clock at night. No more Disneyland for me.\n",

Upon arrival at the airport, you find the point of sale of public transport tickets (RER). If your trip starts on a Monday, it is ideal because you can get the NAVIGO card for 35 euros for a week and use it on all means of transport (metro, trains, buses, etc.), on all lines, it is included and Disneyland... The bad thing is that it is not advisable to take it out midweek because for some reason it is valid from Monday onwards.. We arrived on Saturday, so from the airport to the city of Paris we paid a train of 16 euros per person and when we were taken out at the metro station we bought for 2 days a dozen tickets for within Paris for 17 euros and on Monday morning, at a metro station at a counter with an employee, a very helpful lady issued us a NAVIGO with which we went everywhere without limits... Note , as this card is personal and must have a photo on it, please carry a small photo eg. for a diploma because in the BOX with the automatic photos you will pay 8 euros.. For the transport to the park we took the red line A from Charelet des Halles station in the direction of Marne-la-Vallee (it also has Mikey's sign).. Now as for the park, it is always very crowded so there is a long wait on the roller coasters. We learned afterwards that you can pay extra through the Disneyland app, from 7 to 14 euros (depending on the roller coaster) and you have faster access.. It's worth it... We paid 89 euros entrance for 1 park. In the afternoon we decided to visit the second park as well, we paid plus 25 euros.

If your trip starts on a Monday, it is ideal because you can get the NAVIGO card for 35 euros for a week and use it on all means of transport (metro, trains, buses, etc.), on all lines, it is included and Disneyland... The bad thing is that it is not advisable to take it out midweek because for some reason it is valid from Monday onwards.. We arrived on Saturday, so from the airport to the city of Paris we paid a train of 16 euros per person and when we were taken out at the metro station we bought for 2 days a dozen tickets for within Paris for 17 euros and on Monday morning, at a metro station at a counter with an employee, a very helpful lady issued us a NAVIGO with which we went everywhere without limits... Note , as this card is personal and must have a photo on it, please carry a small photo eg. for a diploma because in the BOX with the automatic photos you will pay 8 euros.. For the transport to the park we took the red line A from Charelet des Halles station in the direction of Marne-la-Vallee (it also has Mikey's sign).. Now as for the park, it is always very crowded so there is a long wait on the roller coasters. We learned afterwards that you can pay extra through the Disneyland app, from 7 to 14 euros (depending on the roller coaster) and you have faster access.. It's worth it... We paid 89 euros entrance for 1 park. In the afternoon we decided to visit the second park as well, we paid plus 25 euros. In general, the whole situation, whatever we say is a bit...Magic...\n",

Sulle isole era interamente in autogestione. Interessante la spiegazione e la dimostrazione sull‚Äôisola di Murano. Considerata l‚Äôesperienza, consiglio di utilizzare i vaporetti di linea per raggiungere le isole in autonomia e organizzarsi per partecipare a una dimostrazione a Murano (specie perch√© il giornaliero o l‚Äôabbonamento per pi√π giorni dei vaporetti viene spesso gi√† acquistato per raggiungere il centro o girare pi√π facilmente la citt√†). In questo modo, ci sarebbe pi√π libert√† nel decidere gli orari degli spostamenti (su alcune isole saremmo rimasti pi√π a lungo di quanto concesso). Se si ipotizza di fare acquisti sull‚Äôisola di Murano, consigliamo inoltre di visitarla per ultima cos√¨ da evitare di dover trascorrere l‚Äôintera giornata con i sacchetti degli acquisti. Infine pensiamo che la visita a Torcello sia da fare se si ha il tempo (e la voglia) di visitare l‚Äôinterno degli edifici sull‚Äôisola (chiesa‚Ä¶ nota: ingresso a pagamento). Per quanto gli edifici all‚Äôesterno siano comunque belli, considerato il percorso a piedi da fare per arrivarci potrebbe non valerne la pena.\n",
