Giulia,Price paid to enter was excessively high considering that we were unable to visit the towers because they were closed to the public. So the driving car was of little use and among other things if you wanted to extend it you had to pay.

But be careful, there are a lot of people, so it is very difficult to take pictures, especially the chameleon on the stairs. There are many people taking pictures, and you will basically be able to take pictures of them. Moreover, the moving line is irreversible. If you miss it, you will have to go around in a big circle before you can come back. Shoot.
By the way, if you want to buy something sold by a roadside vendor, the quality near the entrance is usually a little worse. It is recommended to go further into the park before considering purchasing.",2023-03-27,5,,Helpful,,True,Barcelona,top2,2023,March

Stefán,"The park is amazing. However, entering it was a tough experience, because what I thought was a ticket was only a voucher, which I had to take to an office some 7 minutes away. And as I got lost on the way to there - and time was short, this was a bit frustrating. But the people at the office were very kind and helpful, not least the English speaking guide who helped my a lot and showed a lot of understanding. (The people at the entrances were less nice). ;) So, everything went well at the end. Actually, all information were written in my confirmation mail, but I just overlooked an important part. The main conclusion is: The park shouldn't have more than one entrance. That can easily create trouble for visitors.",2023-06-26,4,Iceland,Helpful,,True,Barcelona,top2,2023,June

The man told us to go around the park to get to the meeting point of Julua Travel. But we would get there too late anyway and our money would be lost. If we waited too long, all the tickets for the park would be sold out. After first trying to contact booking.com and Julia travel by telephone, we also bought the regular entrance tickets so that we could visit the park on the last day when my son was there. Everyone we spoke to at Parc Guel was very blunt and often rude. After the visit, we asked at the Jula travel meeting point if we could rebook to something else. That wasn't possible. We then called someone from the Jula travel office who literally said that they only had one excursion in Barcelona. If we did not want to visit Parc Guel again, we had to send an email asking for a refund, but this was highly unlikely. I sent an email asking to rebook for a number of attractions that I found on the Julia travel site. Or refund. Answer: You must contact booking.com.

The audio guide was a little too long per stop and after a while, when we had entered the Sagrada, no more words could add to the awesome experience of watching the changes in color and light as the afternoon light dissolved to evening. The audio guide was great for architectural detail, etc. but silence is probably better to enjoy the visual details and play of light and color in the church itself! I suggest listening to the audio guide before entering the Sagrada. The music track was spot on though. Thanks!",2023-07-19,4,Philippines,Helpful,family,False,Barcelona,top1,2023,July

Iwona,"The trip was a failure. No one was waiting for us at the designated place, so in panic we ran to the entrance ourselves. However, we couldn't get into the park with these tickets because they were bought through a booking com agent. We contacted the booking com office and one lady told us to try to get in with the second group, which comes in at 1 p.m. So we waited for the second group, but no one came. Another lady told us that the next group gets in every day at 1:30 p.m., so we waited again. That too. no one came. I was told to contact directly the company that organizes these trips, Klook, and ask about getting the money back, but it probably won't work. So I don't understand, if booking.com is an intermediary in organizing these trips, why should I? contact us regarding a refund? We lost 62 euros and a whole day waiting for a company that did not show up at the meeting point.

Kit Ling,"Buying tickets from Klook is very convenient and confirmation is quick. There are many entrances to Park Guell. If you get off at the vallcarca station according to the instructions in the ticket purchase information, I am not sure if I am going the wrong way, but after exiting the station, go straight for a block or two and turn left. It will be a very, very long upward staircase. , and there is a construction site in progress next to the stairs. At the end of the stairs, you will reach the top of the park, which seems to be the back entrance of the park, where you can see a panoramic view of Barcelona. Walk slowly down from the top of the mountain to reach the park's famous square and lizard. Later, when leaving, we walked through the main entrance of the park and followed the road downhill back to Lesseps Station. Therefore, you can consider whether you want to climb a hill outside the park to enter the park. If you don't want to take the stairs, taking the bus to the back entrance of the park and then slowly playing downstream seems to be a better choice.",2023-07-29,5,,Helpful,,True,Barcelona,top2,2023,July

The only thing I would do differently is book a live guided tour as these are far more valuable than the audio tour I booked. I didn't read the booking properly and so hadn't downloaded the audio guide ahead of time or brought my headphones with me, so I was annoyed at myself for this.

Anonymous,The train station is a distance from a steep hill that leads up to the park. Beware if you have children or elderly parents. Advised get a cab up to park entrance. Park is not clearly sign posted and not much shaded or child friendly areas for young children. Would go solo with a friend not with family as was not sure where to start and end tour. Try not to go at peak hours.,2023-08-11,2,,Helpful,family,False,Barcelona,top2,2023,August

The pace had no records of our name on a booking and we proceeded to spend 45mins on a he phone to booking who did not resolve our situation as they had not made the booking but taken our money / rewards! The park was sold out so we could not go in! Booking is currently refusing to refund me as they are incompetent and untrustworthy.

Nangle,"I have always thought that the outside of the Sagrada Familia was spectacular, but it is great to get a close up view of the many facades. I particularly loved the angular statues on the Passion Facade. Once you step inside the temple for the first time you will be amazed by the light inside, with one side filled with bright orange light and the other filled with blues and greens due to the stained glass windows which take up most of the walls. The columns holding up the ceiling are like trees with many branches and the whole effect is stunning. My wife is not particularly into visiting churches, but she absolutely loved it.

Mary,"Booked the one hour tour. due to start at 11am but didn’t start until 11.30 due to latecomers. the instructions are very clear - arrive at meeting point 15 minutes prior to a start time to ensure prompt start (10.45) LATECOMERS WILL NOT BE ACCOMMODATED. I read the instructions carefully as the meeting point was in a street outside the Park - not at any of the the main entrances. I made great effort to arrive as requested. I researched the meeting point the night before and allowed plenty of time as I knew I would need to ask for exact directions once in the area. A number of other people did the same. arriving 5 minutes late is one thing but 3 people arrived as we were about to enter the park at 11.10 (25 minutes after required time). the guide then took about 7 minutes to sort their paperwork out so they could join whilst we were left in the hot sun waiting. then to compound matters another 2 people arrive at 11.18 (over 30 minutes after requested time). instead of the guide advising they were late and moving on she then took another few minutes sorting them out so they could also join. To even further compound matters a man turned up with a small dog in his bag and was advised that dogs were not allowed so that was another 5 minutes wasted sorting him out!!. It was not the guides fault that people were late but it is very unfair on prompt arrivals that latecomers delayed the tour by 30 minutes and left customers such as myself waiting in hot sun. Some people have no consideration for others and the guide was hounded by the latecomers, hence she took the path of least resistance and allowed them to join. the tour itself is interesting but only lasts an hour and was quite expensive. It was peak season, hence absolutely packed with visitors and I would, therefore, not recommend going in August if you can avoid it. queues everywhere as expected and far too hot. I will NEVER join another organised tour, anywhere, because it only takes a small minority of people to ruin the experience. In future I will download apps of tours and make my own arrangements. These tour companies need to stick to the rules. If you’re late then tough - they don’t let you on aeroplanes when the gate closes so the tour company needs to be more robust and ensure that the majority of customers are not sacrificed for the minority who probably always arrive late everywhere. unless there are consequences their behaviour will never change. not much fun waiting in hot sun whilst our tour guide dealing basically with selfish people. even during the tour we had to wait whilst 2 people did not return to the mid point meeting area after the group was given a strict 7 minutes to take photos of the excellent views. what bit about return in 7 minutes don’t people understand?? - 7 minutes to these people is at least 10 minutes!!. In a tour lasting only an hour waiting around for 5 more minutes is quite significant. I’m sure the tour would be more enjoyable out of peak season but I can only state the experience I had. I could see the tour guide just wanted it to be all over ( and I DON’T BLAME HER) as some of the people on my tour had also booked the Sagradi tour and a bus was waiting at 12.30pm to transport them. this reduced the opportunity for questions as the guide was working to a very tight schedule. I was also happy when it was over - going solo is a far better option.",2023-08-19,3,Spain,Helpful,solo,False,Barcelona,top2,2023,August

Anonymous,"The service of this company is terrible. It is definitely an irresponsible and unscrupulous company! I bought many different tickets and tickets on Klook, but this time I was completely disappointed. Please don’t patronize this unscrupulous company again. I bought a ticket to Disneyland Paris and found out that it was an opening day ticket. Then I found that during the few days I was in France, the reservations for Disneyland Paris were fully booked and I couldn't be accommodated at all. At that time, the staff at Disneyland Paris immediately asked me to apply for a refund. I have informed klook of my situation. The reservations for Disneyland Paris in the next few days are all fully booked and I cannot enter. I am requesting a refund. Klook's terrible response is as follows: This is an opening day ticket, available for one year, so it cannot be refunded. Everyone commented, how could Klook require tourists to stay in a foreign country for a long time. Every day I check to see if there is a place to visit the theme park. I have had several days to choose, but there is really no other way so I choose to apply for a refund. Klook also said that the ticket is valid for one year, so I can use it within one year! Therefore, there is no need to refund. I am really sick. Guests need to have a vacation and money to go there again. Are these air tickets, hotels, and vacations all-inclusive by Klook? If you can't do that, don't ask the customer to use it again within a year. You have the guts to say such a thing, and it is extremely unscrupulous and you have swallowed my hard-earned money. There are so many excuses for just a simple refund, which makes me very angry. They don't stand at all from the customer's point of view, thinking that customers are always traveling. You must know that we do not live in different places. We will never patronize klook again in the future, and we also ask everyone not to patronize. I will definitely not let this company go.

We paid 4 entries at a rate of 107 euros, and there is not even an office or a physical person to report to when we arrive! Entries are made in a cinema, where no one knows anything. I call this a big SCAM! We went up to the park with 2 young children in the excruciating heat. The QR code does not give any access to the entrance. We can't reach anyone to find the group! It's a shame, I'm really disappointed because we really wanted to visit this park! I hope we at least get a refund.

So either Booking matches the price of this park, or go directly to the park website to only pay €10!! Otherwise Very beautiful park to visit and don't forget to see the Aqueduct (large columns below a curved path) completely on the right. when you have the large portal in the back because it is impressive with the Mediterranean vegetation around and also don't forget to climb to the top on the hill of the 3 crosses.",2023-08-28,4,France,Helpful,friends,True,Barcelona,top2,2023,August

What disappointed me is the lack of flexibility of the tour operators and no clear communication and instructions of what the tour is all about. Theres a hike before you reach the place.

Christian,"Fantastic Park Guel - definitely worth a visit. Be sure to book online, as is the Sagrada Familia - it is fully booked all summer long and there is no chance of spontaneous entry. Sturdy shoes, food and drinks are an advantage - there are drinking water fountains in the park but only a snack bar with little space. Easy to reach from Placa Catalunya by bus or by taxi for around 13 euros.",2023-09-06,5,Germany,Helpful,family,True,Barcelona,top2,2023,September

Johane,the park is magnificent. However the access could be difficult for some persons. We took the metro to reach the park and there was no indication on the street to orient ourselves. We climbed long stairways in order to reach one entrance of the park.

I asked to reschedule any time over the next two days ; this was curtly refused. Considering the very high price of this ‘attraction’ I found the service appalling.

We then tried to take pictures on the outside but it just looks like a massive building sight, this is a tourist RIP OFF, AVOID AT THIS TIME, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY and time going there until they remove the scaffolding.

I had printed my Booking reservation. But the ticket number was not the scan. Refused entry, we finally received the information to go 2 streets further to meet our guide. Too late, the group was gone. No way to get in even if we agreed to visit alone.

Gloria,"Park Guell is a beautiful, fascinating park in the hills of Barcelona. We took the Hop on Hop off bus to the stop and hiked up the hill for about 10 minutes to reach for main gate to the park. We started at the top of the park and worked our way down, enjoying the views and the Gaudi pieces. We didn't tour the Gaudi home as we heard that it was not worth the extra cost. We found that the bathrooms were in need of renovation. The men's toilet area was very limited as two urinals were out of order. My advice to travellers: Get there early before the crowds and go to the monuments area first. We left it to the last and it was so crowded with people we gave it a pass.

António,"When I booked the tour to Park Guell, the information stated that the tour started at 11:00 in the morning, when I arrived at the park gate at that time I was not allowed entry as we would be included in a guided tour and we did not have tickets, because, After all, what was on the smartphone were not exactly the tickets, despite having 3 barcodes for 3 people, but rather a voucher to go and claim the tickets elsewhere (a situation that was not at all clear in the information contained in the aforementioned vouchers,, after Consult the digital ticket that had been sent to me, I noticed that in a secondary tab on the ticket I mentioned that I would have to be at 10:45 am at a nearby address to join the said tour. I was forced to go to the said address, the guide and the tour had already left, the company representative, who received my €93.00, responsible for issuing the tickets had also left 10 minutes after 11am and with the knowledge that 3 people were missing, thus compromising the possibility of entering without guided tour. I called the said company to resolve the problem, where they told me that they could do nothing except reschedule the tour for another day, I explained that it was not possible as I was going back home that night, nothing was done: I wanted to complain but the services were closed, they sent an email to complain, etc. I even tried to reschedule this afternoon's tour at 5:30 pm, which was also not possible because it was full, ok, issue the tickets so we can enter without a tour, doing the tour on our own, also impossible. In short, terrible experience, horrible service, very questionable good faith, transparency regarding the procedures to be observed completely opaque, flexibility to resolve the situation, zero, what is good is to keep the money fully paid for this miserable service which, after all, was not provided to us. I felt robbed and, worse than that, disrespected by the amateurism of the aforementioned company that gave me the only unpleasant experience in the 4 days I spent in this fantastic Barcelona.",2023-10-16,1,Portugal,Helpful,family,True,Barcelona,top2,2023,October

""what about those who don't have one or who don't want to spend their data as tourists, then the attendant will give you an access code etc.. It's only after 10 minutes that you you will make the visit, mobile to the ear to push on your screen, each time you see the number of the curiosity.

Need more information about the audio app before you get there to understand the architecture idea otherwise don’t Worth the visit just to see the church.

Carlos A.,Emblematic park of Barcelona with designs by Gaudí. Here you find the famous salamander that is one of the symbols of Barcelona along with the Sagrada Familia. It is a very pleasant park to visit with some walks where there are several viewpoints from where you can see Barcelona from a bird's eye view. It is adapted for the disabled. It is very difficult to park around (I recommend a taxi). It seems very bad to me that they charge you an entrance fee to appreciate Gaudí's work.,2023-12-09,4,Spain,Helpful,family,True,Barcelona,top2,2023,December

Anonymous,Park G very focused on crowd control. Even tho our morning there was only modestly attended. Eg. To go to a restroom you may need to go down the hill and around the corner and then back up a bigger hill 400 meters. Or. To go down to the overview plaza if not in a group you are required to go over there 100 meters to use an identical stairway. Access: long hill to hike up if you take the most common bus connection. Maps onsite hard to come by. Good: Some Personnel friendly and multilingual. Many rather authoritarian.,2023-12-25,3,,Helpful,a partner or spouse,False,Barcelona,top2,2023,December

There is also an augmented reality inclusion which is very clever. To visit the museum, make sure you leave time in your tour to have a look.

Michele,"Had some difficulty accessing the online ticket via Booking.com but eventually found the email rather than going through the App and managed to download it. Make sure you do this before you go to the park as the mobile signal is not great there. Fabulous park, very busy, you must pre-book for entry but it opens until 10pm and you can spend as long as you like in the park. It is quite a trek and I was on a mobility scooter so some of the steeps were quite steep but with help I managed. There is a picnic area and kid's play area but quite dusty (we went in January) so I can imagine in the summer it would be worse. The scenery is spectacular as you go up and up and look across Barcelona. Loved the Gaudi artwork all around and would love to see the flowers in bloom in the Summer. I expect it looks glorious. Staff were extremely helpful and arranged immediate access for my scooter through a gateway instead of stairs. Would go again to see the seasonal changes with the the planting.

Overlooking photo area gets really crowded. No long queue in the entrance due to voucher scanning option. Souvenir shop is very well priced, affordable items. Ladies' toilet near the exit gate should be improved. If you want to take the V19 direct bus back to the city, make sure to not exit as they will no longer allow you to reenter. Then you would have to take a long walk to the Metro which was also nice to be able to see the neighborhood, but only if you have more time to spare.",2024-01-16,5,Germany,Helpful,family,False,Barcelona,top2,2024,January

Adrianne,"Interesting park even beyond Gaudi, we saw people walking their dogs, a kids playground, etc. We just did admission but probably should have done a tour of some kind (even an audio tour if they had one). Signage is not developed enough to use that only if you want more background. Easy enough to get to on public transport (bus, the metro still gives you a bit of a walk all uphill). I would recommend it but if you have mobility issues, you'll need to factor in that although there are many flat surfaces, you'd want to figure out the loop using that instead of the many stairs that act as shortcuts.",2024-02-11,4,Italy,Helpful,a partner or spouse,False,Barcelona,top2,2024,February

Andreas,"It worked really well, quick booking and the audio guide was also very helpful. But!!! Why do you have to pay a few extra euros (33 instead of 27 euros) for something you could book directly on the Sagrada Familia official website? Answer because the booking system on the official site is worth a damn, or rather a manipulated scam in Barcelona!!!. You can never pay there, no matter what card or email address you use (supposedly), the booking transaction is simply always canceled. The same is true when booking Park Güell. That's why you unfortunately have to book with other providers. Barcelona, ​​a city of ""official"" fraud.",2024-02-16,5,Germany,Helpful,friends,True,Barcelona,top1,2024,February

Aguero,"The cathedral is awe-inspiring on the skyline of the city. When i first saw it up close my first thought was that the architecture was bonkers. However, there was an audioguide included with the tickets and the explanation of the inspiration and meaning of each part of the building was fabulous, so enjoyable. Timed entry means queues and crowding are not too bad. Recommend booking tickets as much in advance as possible - we were here off peak in Feb and tickets were sold out on the official website 48 hours before we wanted to visit.

We were expecting to be handed a device at the entrance with earphones. Instead, you had to download an app and enter some personal details which included your credit card number (even though it was emphasised this would not be used). I did not have my Bluetooth headphones with me so even if I had been prepared to complete the installation instructions, I would not have been able to listen to the audio commentary. There was no one around to ask if any alternatives were available.",2024-03-09,4,United Kingdom,Helpful,friends,False,Barcelona,top1,2024,March

Elena,"The cost is high to visit a famous park that is so crowded (really a lot) and far from the center. Tourists camp on works that you would like to see or photograph. They eat, drink, sit and don't move, forcing those who want to stay just long enough to admire and take a photo to queue up and make space between them. Unfortunately it is poorly served with transport, as it is uphill the route on foot is impossible, the bus does not stop in front but on the side and obviously it is super crowded too. The metro stops far away and you still have to go uphill. Now that I've seen it once, I wouldn't go back a second time.",2024-03-10,4,Italy,Helpful,a partner or spouse,True,Barcelona,top2,2024,March

Maria_S,"Walking around Florence and listening to Manuel was essential for continuing our visit to the city. We only had two days available and knowing the history of the Medici helped us understand the various monuments and look at them with awareness. We recommend this experience and would like to suggest a couple of things. The first is that if you book but don't go to the appointment it would be correct to inform the guide (we waited for someone in vain... what's more it is not morally correct towards a guide who earns based on bookings). The second is linked to the first: it's true, it's a free offer tour; However, this does not mean taking advantage and paying an inappropriate amount at the end of the tour (just look online at how much tours that require advance payment cost to get an idea).
Having said this, we thank Manuel again, his story full of anecdotes that history books don't tell, his competence and his availability. We would have gladly listened to him for another two hours.

We walked by several significant monuments but she also pointed out small details that would be easy to miss. This was an excellent and easy walking tour especially since it was free tour only paid in tips.  You could have easily paid 30 - 50 euro a person for a walking tour of this quality.

Tanya_R,We really enjoyed learning more about the Medici family and the Florence renaissance from Camilla (Flora's Walk).  We've been to Florence many times before but were with children so didn't partake in guided tours.  What a difference a great storyteller makes!  Learning more about the human elements and experience really brings the city and its history to life.  A great way to begin a visit to Florence and definitely worth 2 hours of your time.  Price is great as well as it's based on donation and goes direct to the guide - well earned!   A plus were the additional tips about visiting the city that Camilla sent out afterwards.

She also offered suggestions for places to eat that were affordable and good.  We have tried two of her suggestions and they were both outstanding.
As a participant of a tour - it is important to follow the guide and enjoy the presentation.  This tour was easy to follow and gave me/us a solid and helpful foundation from the 1300s to the late 1600s.  
The stories and the journey with Debbie was so much fun and so informative - even if history is not your thing!
There was some walking on this tour, but not a lot.  And the tour is not hilly (up and down).  Older folks can do this tour if walking is not a problem!
Thanks Debbie for an amazing tour of Florence!",2023-06-08,5,,Helpful,,False,Florence,top1,2023,June

Laurence,"The crowds taking photographs of David and looking at little were depressing, as was the ignorance of an American lawyer who thought that ‘deposition’ meant taking evidence, and so was baffled by the Botticelli Deposition of Christ from the Cross; but there were wonderful things, and was time to look at them.

Then he went deep into many topics, including the Medici Family, distinguishing between architectural styles, secular importance of churches, navigating Italian cities (e.g., start with the square named after the largest church, the main cathedral door always faces east), famous artists, the meaning behind statues and so much more. He was incredibly knowledgeable, highly educated, and passionate about sharing his love of city and country. He provided dining and sightseeing recommendations when asked, and described best routes to some of the best views of the city. He also kindly shared how he makes a living as a tour guide and recommended tipping standards. He was friendly, helpful and I felt went above and beyond with his knowledge of the city. He stopped at concrete locations and pointed out valuable tools for navigating and understanding what we were seeing and how to identify what we learned after the tour (e.g., the Medieval map in the center of the old market square, the style of arches on the castles, the color of the building material, a 14th century statue wearing attire in a nod to Roman ancestors).

Tiffany_C,"We started our first full day in Florence with this tour in the morning. It was a fantastic way to start off, as it was informative and engaging. Even with a large group, about 30 people, it felt accessible. Our kids said it was their favorite tour out of the ones we did afterwards too. This was a free tour - so it was definitely a steal. A tip was expected at the end, which we didn't mind giving, but it was something we did not originally budget for. If the tour is being offered as free, it should state that tips are expected to compensate the tour guide so as not to catch anyone off guard by the request. Otherwise, this was by far our favorite and we would highly recommend this - just be prepared to tip a minimum of 10 euros per person in your group (we had 5, and only had American dollars on us).

It was only the area around Santa Maria and in including Dante’s house and San Lorenzo, and walking through with a history to the political square.  It was what I expected as advertised.

Official entrance fee is only 16eur each, but here we pay a premium (26eur each) and under 18yo should be free but they also charge for kids 6 and above. So value wise it's not great. Pick up was a bit confusing, listed address is incorrect (so don't follow the address listed on the listing) at the entrance there were all sort of people standing around and you had to ask to find the correct company rep.

After about 15 minutes of waiting we wondered if we were in the wrong line and ended up getting yelled at my security.

Anonymous,"The proposal purchased on Booking turned out to be untrue: in the description it was clear that a child entered for free with a paying adult ticket; so I purchased for 2 adults but at check-in to convert the reservation into a ticket, I was told that I paid 40 euros only for 2 adults and there is no sign of a reservation for the children, and at the checkout we would have paid 38 euros for 4 with the family pack. Furthermore, the instructions on the booking said to collect the tickets valid for entry to an address which is at the castle at the end of the funicular, after taking the stairs, so you would have paid for the funicular for nothing if you had listened to Booking.

So I hiked up the hill to the castle. I suppose I should have checked before I took the hike - I learned that day. So my advice is to just check at the funicular station first to see if the ticket will work or not. Other than that, the castle is beautiful and the views are breathtaking….I highly recommend it.

Our mobile tickets were scanned without a problem and we entered immediately after arrival with everyone else.

It was a rainy day so fewer crowds and lower wait times. Didn't regret it at all. As a young adult couple we had a great time on all the different rides especially Hyperspace Mountain and the Indiana Jones ride which had a 5 min wait all day. Beware that the line for Thunder Mountain is QUICKER if you go to the RIGHT when the queue diverges!!! We tested it.

When inside, it is a very magical place but now as an adult I am aware how small it actually is for the amount is costs and after wiring half hour for 2 separate rides being told they had to close to technical difficulties which I appreciate isn’t their fault but for the money we paid just very annoying and disappointing.",2022-03-23,3,,Helpful,,False,Paris,top2,2022,March

Disappointed, we tried to find a solution and found Viator which was still offering the lowest rate for the same day! A little fearful we made the purchase.

Chloe_W,"The deal is amazing for a Disney Park and the Viator tickets worked perfectly. Would I recommend people to go to Disneyland Paris when they visit Paris? Not if you have been to a Disney park anywhere else. Every ride broke when we were either on the ride or in line to ride. The park is outdated. The Star Wars ride is amazing but is still very much branded Space Mountain. The staff were friendly but there was a lack of magic. I don't feel like anyone was in character. NO walk-ins for restaurants - make sure you book (bookings available two months out) so get the Disney Paris app the moment you get your Viator tickets and book a table. Quite a few things were shut and having works done (Small World and several restaurants). My partner and I have been in Paris for 20 days so far and this was our least favorite attraction so far.

Disneyland was good but it is not very friendly towards people in wheelchairs. First you have to go rent the wheelchair and it is manual only, no electronic scooters are available. Then you have to go stand in line at City Hall for over an hour to get a pass for the wheelchair. Unfortunately I didn’t think about bringing my medical info with me so the pass was denied.  You must have a doctors note to get the pass.  So, we had to skip rides that had stairs in the que line cause we can’t take the wheelchair in.

Kaouthar_M,"Definitely too expensive and too crowded!!! We pay to wait at Disney land Paris! 90’ to take a photo with a princess, 30’ for the pirate ship, 75’ for Peter Pan… in short it’s tiring (especially in the rain).
The highlight of the visit was the parade and the Lion King show for the rest you won't be able to see it :( and I'm not talking about the final show on mean street with the fireworks (we couldn't see anything There were so many people and the people, after a day in their paws, were exhausted and almost violent…).
However, the park remains magical for the children, it was a great moment for them.
Good luck to the great parents who take their child to the park.

Jens,"Our visit to Disneyland Paris leaves a mixed impression: you are drawn into the huge world of Disney characters and films and cannot escape the magic. This is absolutely impressive. Rationally speaking, Disneyland Paris is an average fun park with outdated attractions. The waiting times are sometimes extremely long (the staff sometimes seemed disorganized). You can book easy access tickets for another €160 per person (!) and skip the queues - if your goal is to ride a lot of attractions, this crazy price is probably worth it in the end. Every few meters there are Disney shops where you are encouraged to buy merchandising items. The restaurants mainly offer fast food (burgers, hot dogs, pizza) - the quality of our burger menus was subpar - the prices were galactic (€16 for 1x burger, small fries, 0.5l drink - the first ones were cold - after a complaint it then lukewarm burgers). Still, it was an experience - the kids enjoyed it - but we certainly won't be coming back again.",2023-01-06,3,Germany,Helpful,,True,Paris,top2,2023,January

However, this stops occasionally, and a general commentary is given on the boat itself, which is a bit confusing. Moreover, you hear music in the background and the sound of 'falling' bottles when someone buys something from the drinks machines. There is room for almost 600 people on the boat; so not recommended for people who like a quiet environment or romance.

A VERY IMPORTANT POINT, in order not to receive a fine for travel, buy the correct metro (train) ticket, which is designed for travel outside of Paris. The controllers at the exit from the station and at the entrance to Disneyland fined all the tourists because they had the wrong tickets. A fine of 70€ quite spoils the impression at the entrance to the park:((",2023-02-06,5,,Helpful,,True,Paris,top2,2023,February

Only issue I found was how busy the boat was, possibly pick times when it’s not so busy or use the Batobus which is a jump on and off all day pass to the same thing but better.

Grace,"Even at the happiest place on Earth, there's still kids throwing a temper tantrum. That's not anything against the park I just thought it was funny. A thing I need to say first is the park has a free WiFi, they don't advertise it but there's a QR code when you enter that shows you the map and I think you can order food through it (this'll be important later). A rumor I heard about the park is the queues are long however look for the signs because they show the wait times if one ride says ""40 minutes"" there's probably a shorter line close by and when you're done with that attraction the ride you were originally going for might be down to ""20 minutes"", that said the lines aren't that bad most of them have animatronics or stuff to see so you won't be completely bored waiting. The staff are friendly and they are great showmen, when one in the Frontier World realised he'd walked into a picture I was taking he did a cowboy pose. The only times queuing is a problem is for the restrooms and for food, that's why I was mentioning the app earlier I overheard people talking about ordering food whereas I was stuck in a queue for ages and when I got to the front I had to wait for a group of 7 easily distracted teenagers to make their order. The poor cast member at the till got a talking to by her manager but it wasn't her fault. That said it seems to be hard to find vegetarian food, I'm pescatarian and I had to eat beef just to get some food in my belly. So yeah a highly recommended place, it's just the food situation needs work.",2023-02-20,5,United Kingdom,Helpful,,False,Paris,top2,2023,February

Hector J.,"The facilities on the ship were quite good and the route from the Eiffel Tower to Notre Dame was very well chosen during the sunset or at night, it is more picturesque to see the illuminated buildings and bridges. We were unlucky, because on our boat people decided to start whistling and screaming wildly as they passed under each bridge as if they were possessed and the journey is full of bridges, turning an experience that could be very beautiful and romantic into something stressful and unpleasant, I wouldn't have minded paying more to go with polite and more respectful people on the boat.",2023-03-21,1,Spain,Helpful,,True,Paris,top1,2023,March

Ramya_R,"We booked only the Walt Disney Studios due to time constraints. 1. The place is exorbitantly priced, considering it’s not such a big park compared to the ones in the U.S, and not so visually appealing either. 2. The new Avengers Assemble Flight Force ride was very disappointing, it was only about experiencing force in the dark, there are no characters from Avengers or any highlights in the ride. It gave me a headache and head spin, I spent the morning in the First Aid room in Disney Paris. 3. Everything in the park, including the plays by characters who perform in the park, is in French. I agree it’s the local language of Paris. But for people like me, who don’t understand French, were only wondering what was going on, without much thought or context. So that’s again a let down. 
Conclusion: if you’re willing to spend, if you’re okay with rides that are not so great, (please go to Florida in the US to see the difference) and give you a headache, and if you know French, please go here, and you may not feel so bad.",2023-04-10,3,,Helpful,,False,Paris,top2,2023,April

Public transport trains arrive right under the entrance of the park. Huge parking lot in the park. There are guys everywhere regulating the traffic of both cars and people. There are no traffic jams.

Jonida_H,"As your site does allow to make a review on activities you cancelled on day before the scheduled date (Versailles tickets), I'm sharing here my experience with your company (eventhough I had no issues with Disneyland tickets). 
I booked three activities with Viator. I received the tickets for two of them. For Versaille activity I received only an e-mail with the reference of the activity, advising me that it wasn't the final ticket and informing that I'll receive my final tickets 1 day before that activity.
I contacted the customer care via e-mail and was informed qoute "" The ticket will be sent a day before your travel date because the schedule is final and cannot be changed"".
A day before the travel date I was expecting the final tickets, but instead I was informed that the my tickets were canceled from YO Tours. I didn't know nothing about this third party untill I booked and make the payment. I was not able to canceled after this because these tickets were unrefundable.
After that I was not able to get other tickets, because this attraction was fully booked.

Rodrigo,"The digital entry was very convenient, since I would not be generating more papers nor would I have problems if the page with the QR code was folded. Of course, you must have mobile data to access the entry or download the pdf beforehand. Although, the park has WIFI, it is not always stable. And it is advisable to download the park application to know what attractions there are and the services they offer. But sometimes, the attractions said they were available in the app and while in line, they said that it would be out of service, without prior notice, as well as the opening and closing information of some restaurants, because not all of them stay open until midnight. 11pm. As a tip, if you are going to stay until the final lights event and your means of transportation is the train. Try to leave 5 minutes before the event ends, or run as quickly as possible to the train because the tickets may fail, or the train may be very crowded.",2023-06-05,5,Panama,Helpful,,True,Paris,top2,2023,June

Children and families were held back until the restaurants (with really bad fast food) and the boutiques were closed. A real impudence! Many a child's dream was shattered that evening (and the evenings before?). Commerce is more important - this was very clear to all visitors.

Anyhow the service in the boat didn’t do anything to prevent it and didn’t even asked if I needed help. They should be more couches and taking measures about this incident.

George,"First of all I will try to help on how to travel in Paris.. If your excursion starts on Monday, it is the best, because as soon as you arrive at the airport you find the place where they sell train tickets (RER). There you get the navigo card where you use it on all means of transport unlimitedly, Paris, Disneyland.... Because it's a personal card, you have to take a small passport-type photo with you, etc. It also has machines with automatic photos, but you'll be late. Regarding the park, it would be good to download the Disneyland app that will help you, paying an additional cost (6 to 9 euros) for each roller coaster to avoid the huge queues, at least at the time we went (June). We had pre-paid the tickets for the park for 89 euros and 82 for children.. As for the rest, I can't describe it, it's truly MAGICAL........",2023-06-29,5,Greece,Helpful,,True,Paris,top2,2023,June

George,"First I will help about how to get around in Paris in general.. Upon arrival at the airport, you find the point of sale of public transport tickets (RER). If your trip starts on a Monday, it is ideal because you can get the NAVIGO card for 35 euros for a week and use it on all means of transport (metro, trains, buses, etc.), on all lines, it is included and Disneyland... The bad thing is that it is not advisable to take it out midweek because for some reason it is valid from Monday onwards.. We arrived on Saturday, so from the airport to the city of Paris we paid a train of 16 euros per person and when we were taken out at the metro station we bought for 2 days a dozen tickets for within Paris for 17 euros and on Monday morning, at a metro station at a counter with an employee, a very helpful lady issued us a NAVIGO with which we went everywhere without limits... Note , as this card is personal and must have a photo on it, please carry a small photo eg. for a diploma because in the BOX with the automatic photos you will pay 8 euros.. For the transport to the park we took the red line A from Charelet des Halles station in the direction of Marne-la-Vallee (it also has Mikey's sign).. Now as for the park, it is always very crowded so there is a long wait on the roller coasters. We learned afterwards that you can pay extra through the Disneyland app, from 7 to 14 euros (depending on the roller coaster) and you have faster access.. It's worth it... We paid 89 euros entrance for 1 park. In the afternoon we decided to visit the second park as well, we paid plus 25 euros. In general, the whole situation, whatever we say is a bit...Magic...",2023-07-05,5,Greece,Helpful,,True,Paris,top2,2023,July

Trine,"There was a lot of queue, of course. A tip is to stand in the singles queue. I didn't like that it was only an app and not a paper map - they should have offered both. Few exciting attractions for older children, i.e. the 16-year-old. The studio park was the best. Could have been signposted better and more clearly. Difficult to find, in addition it was difficult to see the writing on the few signs that were since they were engraved and thus in the same color as the sign - not UU-friendly. We spent a lot of time figuring out the app, and the network was not optimal, which led to a delay in the map and we went wrong. Few employees asked for help, and those we asked gave us the wrong answer. Little visible celebration of the 30th anniversary, which was also the reason why we went. Several attractions were not in operation, these should have been in order for an anniversary.",2023-07-06,2,France,Helpful,,True,Paris,top2,2023,July

Krzysztof,"Of course this is an amazing place to visit, Premier Access is a must, otherwise you end up waiting in line for hours. Check out the rides before you go and try to plan your visit as much as you can. I was a little disappointed by the availability of the Disney characters. They show up in some places for a while and we don't have a single picture with any of them so that's another thing you have to plan. Its also unclear what ride is what, some are very extreme with elevators falling tens of meters and people crying while others are literally a boat ride with singing dolls for 10 minutes so it really varies (which is a good thing) make sure you know what you are waiting for. I got tickets for 2 days and premier access for just one day and ended up not even going to the park for the 2nd day (we went back to walk around Paris). The premiere access is almost double the cost of tickets but you can do all of the attractions (that have premiere access) from both disneyland and disney studions in one day. Note that not all attractions are available like that i think about 30% are available. So you want to go see mickey - wait for 1h you want to see a princess or whatever - wait 1h.",2023-07-11,4,Poland,Helpful,family,False,Paris,top2,2023,July

Marie-Line,"We arrived 20 minutes early and access to the boat was smooth. Despite this we found ourselves on the right front edge of the boat, at the bottom. We therefore missed all the information on the monuments on the left, because on the way back there were no more comments. We only had a glimpse of Notre Dame because on the wrong side on the way out and back we passed to the other side of the city island, no more visibility.

In the disney park we are then rejected since we want to enter park 2 and are directed to park 1. Back in park 1, I would like to buy access to park 2 but am directed to go back to park 2. But since we have already been turned away once at the park 2, I don't want to go back. Regarding your app about the park. It would be a huge advantage if you would also show where the toilets are located.

Melvin,Had great days at Disneyland! We did 1 day in the park and 1 day in the studio and saw and did everything we wanted. Service was great! Since we had made a mistake in the app by purchasing tickets for the wrong park. Sometimes a bit unclear in the app. Customer service resolved this perfectly and we received a voucher for the next day. Had great days!,2023-08-10,5,Netherlands,Helpful,family,True,Paris,top2,2023,August
Monica_O,"Had no problems at all using the tickets from Viator.  I had downloaded our tickets to the Disneyland Paris app (I’d read that this would be convenient to do), but they would not accept those at the gate.  Luckily I also had the Viator tickets in the wallet on my phone!

We only had this one day to visit the park, so it was perfect that we had this ticket that we used for Disney Studios Park.  We covered everything we wanted in this one day.",2023-08-10,5,,Helpful,,False,Paris,top2,2023,August

Nico,"Queues were much longer than announced. Prices for drinks way too high. 5 euros for an ice cream. Attractions were very beautiful. There is nothing to complain about. I would stay under 100 euros for the entrance fee. It's really not worth more. Bookings sent the tickets quickly and they worked.

Erwin,"This was our first time at Disneyland Paris. It is a fairly expensive park where I expected Disney to be plentiful. Due to the presence of Disney characters and mood makers/actors in the park. However, it turned out to be an ordinary amusement park that hardly surpasses the Efteling. Even Slagharen manages to maintain the atmosphere in the park better than Disneyland Paris. We stayed until closing. You will be treated to a light show at the palace. Technically impressive but also without atmosphere/feeling and without the Disney characters. On the way to the exit I saw the first Disney character on a balcony waving us goodbye (Mickey). Because the various parking areas are not clearly and conspicuously signposted, our visit ended with a wander/search for the car. We were not the only ones considering the line that had to go through the check-in desk again for inspection at 12 o'clock at night. No more Disneyland for me.",2023-08-10,2,Netherlands,Helpful,family,True,Paris,top2,2023,August

Like those who don't yet have a ticket, you have to queue in the same endless line, in full sun. Since there are many options for taking such a tour, it is much better to decide on the spot which company you want to join.

The only problem is that there are people who have no respect for others, the boat has a capacity for around 600 people seated, I believe they don't let more people in than the boat's capacity, but there are people who travel standing up, blocking the field of vision. whoever goes after.

Sabine,"Too many people, too few toilets, too few umbrellas (very hot, few shaded areas but also helpful when it rains). Shopping Disney would be more appropriate at every post Shopping the children couldn't concentrate on the park. Too few retreats to take a break. The parades were flooded with people and there were no opportunities for the children to see them. The worst was the 11 p.m. event, it took place in the sky and you could have seen it if it weren't for the adults who held their Hy up to film literally hundreds of Hy up with their arm outstretched, no child or adult could do that what to see... too few benches. The waiting times were due to the large number of people. The cleanliness here was positive, 10 points, grade 1, big praise for the employees who always cleared away all the rubbish, drinks and food were all very good and in my opinion the prices were also ok. We were in the park with 3 children and 2 adults.

Ana Belén,"When I went to Disneyland I did it because, being in Paris, it was ""a touch"" but I had never had a predilection nor was it something pending in my life. As I crossed the entrance, I realized that this was not like any other park. Now I understand the obsession and ""geekism"" that I have observed in my last months of research, with Disneyland. From the parking lot itself you can smell and feel the magic and excitement. The employee training, the parades, the musicals and even the toilets themselves remind you at every moment that you have paid almost 100 bucks for something. I came away wanting much more since I was only in one of the 2 parks and for a single day. Like ""Jaws""... I WILL BE BACK",2023-08-31,5,Spain,Helpful,family,True,Paris,top2,2023,August

Maciej,"A short one-hour cruise on the Seine. It departs from under the Eiffel Tower, so you can easily combine the cruise with a visit to the Tower. The cruise and the ship itself were OK, the only thing missing on the ship was the lack of a bar/catering (it is not necessary, but on all previous cruises in which I participated, there was smaller or larger catering). Overall, I recommend it!",2023-09-03,5,Poland,Helpful,a partner or spouse,True,Paris,top1,2023,September

The cruise was comfortable, provided free commentary through your own phone after scanning QR code. We did not wait long for boarding, they run very often.

Anonymous,"The attractions are very nice, you will definitely be satisfied. But the lines are very long, we waited 45 minutes to get on the train, the day ends due to long waiting times and you cannot get on everything you planned. The staff was a bit sullen, I expected them to be always smiling, especially since it was Disneyland. Stores are too expensive. Some of the cafes close at 6, most of the rides close at 20.30, you cannot ride until the end of the day, this disappointed us. We went with a stroller and had to take the stairs somewhere because there was no elevator. People with strollers and people with disabilities have not been considered much, but we have already seen this throughout France. Despite these shortcomings, it is a place worth visiting. If you plan the day correctly, you will wait less and leave happier. The light show at night is excellent, don't miss it.",2023-09-07,5,,Helpful,family,True,Paris,top2,2023,September

Konstantina,Everything was great there was a very long queue for each child. I would suggest that you take it with you because the prices in the park are very expensive.

It was hard to find at first because things are very well signposted in Paris if it wasn't for using my google maps I likely might not have found it. The boat was ok and there was toilets onboard. It had an onboard app you could download to listen to the commentary about the landmarks which was good. Other than that there wasn't much info as they do rely on you downloading this.

With children, it is better to take entrance to one park, since there are so many places you want to go, and the queues are long. I was alone, so I managed to visit 2 parks from 10:00-21:00.

Tammy_K,"I was actually concerned thinking how could these be legit for 1/2 the price & I worried as I approached the turnstiles...  But they worked & we had a fantastic day at Disneyland Paris for a fraction of the cost.  You select the date you're going when you purchase them & have easy access to the ticket(s) the day of - scan them at the turnstiles & voila... You're ready for the adventure to begin.  It couldn't have been an easier/better transaction.  Thnx viator for a wonderful experience from start to finish.  I absolutely recommend purchasing Disneyland Paris tix via Viator to anyone.  Unless you want to pay double (full price) on the Disney site or you can get both parks for the price of 1.  I wish they had this option stateside!!!  
BTW - Sept is a great month to go to DP.  Fewer people - the longest line we waited in was for Hyperspace Mountain at 40 mins.  We rode everything in 5 hrs & could have done both parks in 1 day.  ...and the weather was gorgeous.   I'll be back every Sept!!!",2023-09-18,5,,Helpful,,False,Paris,top2,2023,September

franco,"Booked on August 30th at Booking.com the two tickets for September 18th. Received booking confirmation, printed and if in doubt on your mobile phone. Once we arrive at Disneyland... we wait in the first queue for 15/20 minutes. Passed the security check... second line always 15/20 minutes. On our turn, our ""tickets"" don't let us through and after trying in every way, an attendant tells us that they are not active and therefore we will have to go to another entrance to have the tickets activated/verified. Another thing for desperate people like us in 30 minutes. At our turn, luck favors us and the boy at our counter is of Italian origin, after explaining to us that we should have received some kind of confirmation from who we had booked. The next line of questions follows... when did you make the reservation? Are you sure the response didn't go to spam? Show me your cell phone…. But there is no booking on your website or Booking.com profile... even though you have the confirmation sheet!!! Then he calls two other colleagues who leave their positions and start fiddling with the keyboard, asking questions to which I no longer knew what to look for or answer. After 20/25 minutes and a queue that was noisy and growing visibly... a ""maybe we've found it"". They print the two famous tickets for me. We queue again for 15/20 minutes at Disneyland, a marvelous entrance with the castle and there is immediately a parade of floats with music and thousands of people queuing and a bit harassed with children, prams, families and a lot of adults like us. Once the parade of film characters is over, we can finally start looking for the famous attractions that were recommended to us or that I had read that shouldn't be missed... Space montain (I think that's what it's called) …. Closed for maintenance..🫣. Then we queue next to it, the shortest one! 30 minutes and then discovering that the attraction consisted in having a photo taken with Dark... I don't know …. Bad character from Star Wars 😵…. We still wander far and wide. But only things for small children is full of adults who are disoriented and tired of wandering around in vain or queuing for 45 to 60 minutes. Looking at the map we see that next to it are the attractions most suitable for adults. We aim decisively and once we arrive at the entrance, they tell us that we cannot enter with the ticket because it was only valid for one of the two... Disneyland or Studios... Certainly someone who is going for the umpteenth time, but for us who were going for the first (and absolutely last) time…. I go to Disneyland... as if I go to Gardaland... I enter where Disneyland is... At 56 euros each 😵. So with many hours of useless queues and a lot of anger, we decide to return to Paris. The total ridiculousness (and the reason for this outburst of mine) comes to me from you Booking.com the question... how was your day at Disneyland? But then did you know that we had booked with you…. But there was no way to trace the booking. And then I redid the entire booking simulation and in no case, even on the Disneyland.com website, was there any specification or suggestion regarding the fact that families with children should go mainly from one area... and the Studios which are intended for a public more adult and not suitable for small children who could hardly do any of the attractions. This is the first time I've written such a negative review.... But a wasted day and what's more between tickets, return trips to Paris, plus food breaks and a sandwich....a nice 230 euros 💶 give as a gift 🤷🏻‍♂️",2023-09-20,1,Italy,Helpful,a partner or spouse,True,Paris,top2,2023,September

We were allowed to tell him that we had no place and that we had no choice. A member of the team arrived and clearly spoke to us very coldly, telling us that we had no right to “get in the way”. the view of people.

The train around the park is for nothing. At first you only see bamboo, then a car, tunnel and not a few animals. We also queued for 1 hour for this.

Of course we chose places where we didn't have to wait in line for too long.

Please buy directly from the Disneyland website. 
Remember DO NOT BUY from VIATOR is really super lousy customer service as well when cannot even call at all !!

Michael_S,"Super enjoyable experience under all aspects, and things with the booking went very smooth. Please don't listen to all those writing that their tickets didn't work, something must have gone wrong with their booking in first place, or they didn't follow the instructions. The process is very easy: buy the tickets, activate them via the Viator mobile app, download the QR codes, go to the entrance, scan the codes provided by Viator and enter the park. Please note that these tickets won't work on the Disneyland app though, since you are buying them from a third party. Enjoy this wonderful experience!",2023-10-10,5,,Helpful,,False,Paris,top2,2023,October

I recommend arriving at door opening or within the first hour of opening like we did. especially if you want to take photos and drop any bags off any guest services as we just beat the crazy queue onto Space Mountain. I also recommend downloading the Disney app prior to arriving. Book any Character meets you would like to do BEFORE as slots fill up very quickly during the day.

You usually have to queue outside for the attractions. Mickey mouse ears cost 25 euros each. You pay whatever the token is throughout the park. What was nice was the parade and the fireworks, although the fireworks could have been a little earlier instead of at the park's closing time.

There are, however, points to improve: 1. The air conditioning was very high and had outlets close to one of the accommodation areas, which became very uncomfortable; 2. It is irrational for exits to only be through one door on the boat. If there are several, for a better flow, they should be used. Finally, between trips, one cannot understand the slowness of the staff, with a huge queue of customers waiting to enter. All in all, I would repeat it again and recommend it.",2023-12-09,4,Portugal,Helpful,a partner or spouse,True,Paris,top1,2023,December

Fabio,"The ferry leaves hourly, but they don't warn of the crowds crowding onto the pier in the hope of getting in, creating a first queue to sort people for the boarding phase, and then the second queue for boarding itself. It goes without saying that, if you have a few days available to visit as many attractions as possible, waiting more than an hour and a half to tour the Seine is not acceptable. - I give one star but it definitely would have been an interesting ferry ride; I recommend going when there isn't a soul in line, or at least don't buy tickets at hourly intervals, since the ticket office is there anyway and then you can judge there... - The only consolation, I used the money from the Booking Wallet like this I haven't lost a euro on it.",2023-12-15,1,Italy,Helpful,a partner or spouse,True,Paris,top1,2023,December

Tim,We arrived 30min before the time of the cruise and there was a queue of 200m+ long. This would have meant a wait of 2.5hrs and perhaps we might of got on the last boat. They were encouraging people to come back any day in the next 30 days. Not possible on a two day trip to Paris. There is no warning of the demand on Booking.com but was on the top of ur attractions list. There is no refund or cancelation possible thru Booking.com. That has to change. Will not be recommending this to anyone and will warn against booking.com attraction recommendations unless I get a refund. Generally not good enough.

Tarik,"Friday 1 p.m., the laughter and enthusiasm of my children fill the car. Especially my son who loves Lightning McQueen, The Lion King and Spiderman. He, the blessed one who is not yet equipped to make a socio-political analysis, had been waiting for a week of eternity for this Christmas/St Nicholas gift. After picking them up from school earlier, we set off for Disneyland Paris, where every corner is supposed to embody magic and wonder. For them, it's a dream world; For me, a parent, it's the opportunity - I thought - to offer them an unforgettable moment. Unforgettable for them but also for me when my more or less informed eye peers behind the scenes of this papier-mâché utopia. Saturday morning, we are welcomed by the iconic castle, a symbol of fantasy perfection. The fairytale characters, the sparkling attractions, everything seems out of a dream, even the soap bubbles that fall on us by the thousands. But beyond the brilliance, I begin to perceive the less brilliant nuances of this chiaroscuro picture. Mass tourism at Disneyland Paris is palpably evident. The long queues, the compact crowds, the frenetic pace – all this reveals a reality where the dream is consumed en masse. Each “land” is a dehistoricized and depoliticized replica of different corners of the world or different universes, presented in a devitalized and stereotypical manner. Each “land” thus presents a watered-down and often stereotypical version of different regions and eras. For example, Adventureland seems to reduce Africa and Asia to a set of exotic clichés. Likewise, Frontierland evokes the American West in a way that obscures painful historical realities, including colonization and the oppression of indigenous peoples. It is also difficult not to be aware of the way in which the space itself is organized. Spatial hierarchies at Disneyland reflect and reproduce social hierarchies. The central spaces are devoted to dominant and universally recognized narratives, while the peripheries accommodate more diverse, but often simplified and exoticized, narratives. This spatial arrangement is not accidental, but reflects deliberate choices that privilege certain stories and experiences over others. As I wander around, I am further struck by the omnipresence of consumption. Every attraction, every show, every square meter is designed to maximize spending, transforming the experience into a succession of purchases. Disneyland is not (just) an amusement park, it is a giant shopping center disguised as a fairyland. Nature, for its part, is carefully controlled and staged. Each tree, each flower bed is meticulously maintained to create the illusion of perfect nature, far from its wild and unpredictable form. It reminds me how our relationship with the environment is often based on control and aesthetics, instead of appreciation of its raw, natural form. And what about the employees? Behind their costumes and their smiles hides a reality of rigorous work, often little valued. Their role is to perpetuate the illusion of a perfect world, but what is the personal and professional cost of this human setting? As I leave the park, I feel a conflict within me. My children take “magical memories” with them, but for me, this weekend was full of reflections on the complexity of our quest for perfection and happiness, particularly as a parent. Disneyland Paris, in its attempt to create a utopia, reflects the paradoxes of our society: the search for an ideal world while navigating the realities of mass tourism, excessive consumption, planetary limits and hyper representation. simplified world. This experience renewed my awareness of the importance of seeking a balance between the magic of dreams and taking into account reality in all its complexity. Perhaps it is time to redefine our conception of utopia, incorporating a more acute awareness of our impact on the world and on others. Back home, the question of tourism consistent with the low-tech approach and respect for planetary limits becomes obvious to me. My next trip will be an opportunity for a respectful discovery of local traditions, crafts, gastronomy and lifestyles. I will then contribute to a fairer economy, by supporting small traders and artisans. Our tourism activities would include learning experiences about the environment, local biodiversity, and ecological challenges, low tech practices. Rather than constantly seeking to consume and be entertained, we will take the time to appreciate the beauty and tranquility of natural landscapes, to reconnect with ourselves and with nature. Far from the overstimulation of large parks, we will prioritize satisfying a legitimate need to disconnect from everyday life and reconnect with our loved ones. By promoting these authentic interactions and moments of sharing, low-tech local tourism would not only be a more sustainable way to travel, but also a valuable opportunity to strengthen family and friendly ties. It would be about celebrating the richness of our human relationships and recognizing that, in an increasingly connected world, true connection is often found in the simplicity of shared moments.",2023-12-18,1,Luxembourg,Helpful,family,True,Paris,top2,2023,December

But the organization was a bit strange. When we arrived and queued, the entrance was closed after 10 minutes. The boat was full. All tour groups were given priority!?!? We were told the next ship would leave in an hour. But we were in the front row. But none of us were willing to spend an hour in the rainy, cold weather. So we went to the nearest bistro on the pier. But that was it for the “front row” when we got back. Were afraid that the situation would repeat itself. But 10 minutes before departure, everyone on the ticketed side (no tour groups) was let in. That was a bit strange!!!! But the trip itself was great!!! The ship itself was comfortable, clean, warm and you could also go outside, along the railing, to experience the action outdoors and take photos or films.",2023-12-20,4,Austria,Helpful,family,True,Paris,top1,2023,December

Mynor Alejandro,"I recently went on a river cruise in Paris and it was an okay experience. There were some pros, like the boat being spacious and accommodating a lot of people. It was interesting to see the city from a different angle. However, there were a few negatives. Firstly, they didn't have a liquor license, so the one-hour cruise felt incomplete without a drink, which was disappointing. Secondly, the commentary was mainly in French, and their offer to download translations didn't work well, making it hard for non-French speakers to fully enjoy the tour. Lastly, the return journey was confusing as the boat did several 360-degree turns near the Statue of Liberty without any explanation.

KAREN_A,"I scanned my ticket and then the security claimed that my other family member scanned my ticket and so they kicked us out. I legit wasted money and they tried to say that we were doing fraud. They didnt even let me stay at all and the woman security were being bitchy with attitude and sass. I did not say any curse words to them and why they were speaking in French all fast and mad. Legit it wouldv'e been fair for me to stay in as I had my paid ticket and my other family member's ticket wasn't working apparantly because the date wasn't reserved. They could've approached the situation much more nicer or allowed him to get in. It was legit 4pm and I don't understand how tickets are ""sold out"" when people can come in and out at any time. Waste of money, waste of reservation I had made for my birthday dinner, Crappy ass mean ass security, the spanish woman at the ticket scanner is a snitch and I wasn't able to catch her anymore. All she could've done is been al ot more nicer about the ticket. The black, african security man also could've been nicer rather than claiming we did fraud or saying he will call the police or we need to be escorted out when legit I did not touch you, curse at you, or even rob anything. I'm sure there are other people who have done the worst things at disney and not even escorted out. Terrible system and security staff.",2024-01-06,1,,Helpful,,False,Paris,top2,2024,January

Guilherme,"Interesting experience, but overrated. A walk by the Seine or a hop on hop off bus is a better experience and you will see and experience a lot more. Unfortunately (under no control of the service company) the water level was high on the Seine so the original planned was not possible. Looking at the reviews now it seems that the high water issue is pretty common and woudl be great it the charter companies posted about the likelihood is low for doing the original trip during the months of November to February to avoid disappointments. On the plus side the service crew was great, (the girl on the microphone from Portugal spoke several languages amazingly well and was super nice!) The boat was fairly clean, and seats available throughout (the upper deck was unfortunately closed). Overall I would say an ok ride, but go instead for a walk or bus service.",2024-01-08,3,United States,Helpful,family,False,Paris,top1,2024,January

Anonymous,"We traveled with four children between 5 months and 9 years old. We found the atmosphere positive; you immerse yourself in another world. Yes, Disney makes it snow out of the blue at 7 degrees plus and plays Let it snow. Yes, it is magical, it casts a spell over you and you are captivated. Huge, ostentatiously decorated Christmas trees. Breathtaking shows and lighting effects. Roller coasters that give you a thrill... Seeing Disney characters... That's the reason why we were there, our children enjoyed this atmosphere. At the beginning our tickets were no longer available via the app, but that was a minus point from our side. Booking was able to solve the problem, albeit with a long time (2 hours) and endless phone calls in different languages. Now to the criticism of the park: Let's look at the park from the perspective of the children target group: - no family check-in, both at the security check and in the park. Everyone goes everywhere, zero organization. There are tens of people at the wheelchair/stroller entrance, neither wheelchairs nor strollers. - The park is getting old, paint is peeling off, attractions e.g. Buzz from the 90s, little current e.g. Frozen, Miraculous etc - Waiting times even to meet Mickey are 60 minutes (Fast Pass possible costs as much as the entrance fee) - even at that Toilets and restaurants eternal waiting - biggest negative point: we were eating and I wanted to sit at a table with the children while my husband gets food and breastfeed our smallest for a short time. The staff refused to let us do that, instead we were supposed to dare with 4 children stand in line for food or go out to breastfeed. When we had eaten we were allowed to look for a free place with our children, a stroller and 4 trays full of food.... I would have expected more organization - prices... Yes it's Disney and yes it's magical. But almost double figures for a small pack of popcorn? The Fast Pass as much as the entrance fee? Apart from eating, drinking and souvenirs, our conclusion: you can do it, but you should think carefully about whether the money is worth it",2024-01-08,3,,Helpful,family,True,Paris,top2,2024,January

Unfortunately, even though we booked tickets online, we still had to wait in an extremely long line and waited for at least over an hour (and I saw many other people in the same position as us, but because we could not return our tickets that we booked online, we all stuck it out).

Svetlana,"Super! unexpectedly the prices for food were not too high (we expected the prices to be astronomical, but no), in general, souvenirs and related products are quite affordable. When entering the attractions, you can conveniently see on the board how long to wait in line. We took one park a day, it was not in season, the queues were not very long, but even then we only had time for those attractions that were marked “Do not miss”; in the season, we probably wouldn’t have completed even half of them.",2024-01-23,5,Serbia,Helpful,family,True,Paris,top2,2024,January

Dan_L,"A magical time in an adventure that we will never forget. It was as if we were transported into a dream world, with princesses, dragons and magical creatures. We flew over the world with Peter Pan, made friends with Elsa and Anna from Frozen and discovered ""It's a small world"" where children were the only inhabitants and it was their world completely. Truly amazing things realized inside of Disneyland Paris.
Thank you all!

And thank you Viator that you made it possible for us to enter Disney, as without you our child wouldn't have been there. We did a mistake and in one of the 2 days there, we realized we were in front of Disneyland gate without any ticket at hand. And buying a last minute wouldn't have been possible for us, being twice the price. Through Viator we still got the normal price, it was truly magical and we thank you so much, without you things would have been not nearly as great at Disney for us!",2024-01-31,5,,Helpful,,False,Paris,top2,2024,January

Of course we only found out about this on the boat. You could only stand outside (around, so you could only see what was on one side, but not what was on the other side). There were enough seats inside but you could hardly see anything. I recommend a boat where you can sit on the upper deck otherwise it's not worth it at all.

The boat trip itself was very pleasant and goes a far way down the river then doubles back, it was also easy to find and get to, there was lots of seating available as most people went on the roof (it was a dry day). However the on-board commentary system needs rework: the built in 'phone' receiver you can pull out produced no sound at all, I saw nobody else using it with any luck and they are only available inside, so nobody on the roof heard anything other than the very few points spoken over the overhead speakers. Instead I was only able to hear the full commentary using my own headphones which I plugged into the system, and even then I missed some bits of it as the audio cut-out now and then. Its a nice thing to do to get off the streets and learn some of the history but the kit needs fixing to make the experience work properly.",2024-02-20,3,United Kingdom,Helpful,solo,False,Paris,top1,2024,February

There were a few construction sites that stood out, probably because there were a lot of things under construction. Even if you had to wait, you could ride the attractions in about 40 minutes, and compared to Disney in Japan, you could complete the ride in one day, and there were many attractions that you could ride for an additional fee. I was lining up to see the show at the end, but I was a little disappointed that I couldn't watch it due to a sudden problem.

Steven,Great one hour to take out your day to cruise along the river to see the sights of Paris. Big queues on arrival which very quickly dwindles down as the boats carry loads of passengers at a time. Booked our tickets through Booking.com in advance which was an open ticket with no set time as long as you choose the actual day you wish to travel........highly recommended !!!!,2024-03-11,5,United Kingdom,Helpful,a partner or spouse,False,Paris,top1,2024,March

It's something special with many attractions, games for all ages and all tastes. Hyperspace, stellar is something sci-fi and must be tried, but being healthy that day is recommended and not eating too much before. It's good to get to the park in the morning because it's freer and there are queues at many attractions. So you can spend the whole day in the park to see as much as possible. The ticket is a bit expensive but once you enter, you don't pay any more, unless you want some food and drink from there or for souvenirs. All games and attractions are included in the ticket price.

Although if your intention is to stay on one of these islands for more than an hour or so, I recommend to find a different way of transportation. In our case we were very satisfied with the transportation and little pieces of interesting facts they gave while we were on the boat. While on the islands you are on your own. Be always aware to return to the boat on time , otherwise you will be left behind with no right to a refund. Form the three islands Burano is by far the most amazing. In our case we decided to stay on this stop and then find our own way back to Venice, because we went to a restaurant and it took a while for the food to be ready.

Sharon_A,"I wasn’t expecting to have other tour agencies combined onto one boat so be aware that there is a possibility you will have a very full boat depending on the time of year you are doing this excursion. That said, I don’t think it’s going to matter which tour agency/company you purchase from. And because of the huge amounts of people the guided portion part of the tour was spoken in Italian, English, Spanish and German. So props to the guide for having to speak multiple languages however a big subpar for a customer as you’re only getting snippets of facts. Nonetheless, touring the other islands I think is a must from taking a break from Venice. The glass demonstration was fun on Murano and I ended up buying a few glass pieces. Burano was beyond delightful. You’ll be charmed by all the colorful houses. As for Torcello, I personally could have done without or would have wanted to use that time instead on Burano and Murano but it’s a part of the tour so I guess enjoy Torcello as much as you want. The majority of the boat already came back to our meeting point well before call time. It’s still a worthwhile excursion to do.

We had to sit at the back of the boat but realised later it did not have speakers so could not hear any of the itinerary details which was a problem on the first island as we didn't know what time to meet back on the boat. Murano was pretty, Torcello was not, and the cafe we went to had their toilet shut off from use, even though most of the boatload bought food there. Burano was beautiful though and made up for the previous island. The local people were all out in the town and everyone was friendly, the shops were lovely, and it was so picturesque, it was well worth the visit.

Indeed it was difficult to know what language was being spoken. Would have been better to just take the vaporetta and a book.

Once we actilually arrived (after walking about 35 minutes very fast), the staff were most polite and helpful, making us wait (understandably) at the back of the church until there was a break in the music. This gave us a chance to regain our breaths discreetly. Once we had settled in to our seats, the experience was absolutely sensational.  The maestro (Alberto Martin) directed his little group effortlessly and with original interpretation of the well-known music, in a most refreshing and compelling way.  The players are all most accomplished experts, well balanced and harmonious. We really enjoyed it very much indeed, despite our hasty and disorganised arrival.

The commented one man show of a local glassmaker was certainly interesting on Murano, and the photogenicity of the local architecture on Burano. And I went to Torcello to see the devil and I wanted to visit the local museum. I caught up with the devil and ran to the return ship, which I did not catch.

Tiziana,"The tour itself is really beautiful and interesting, it allows a quick vision of the most famous beauties of the lagoon... rapid indeed, very rapid, a continuous race against time... you have about an hour per stage between going up and down becomes 45 minutes, I strongly recommend that you organize yourself with a packed lunch because otherwise you have to choose whether to visit the location or have lunch... it would be enough to extend the 2nd stage by at least half an hour because, especially for those with small children, it is not always possible to be so smart . Organizers think about it!! I also suggest contacting the agency by phone to confirm the meeting point as the printout showed an address (at a non-existent number with no reference points) and instead when I called I was told to reach a point near Piazza San Marco..

However, if you only have a short amount of time overall, the tour is the opportunity to see all three islands.

Vincent,"Found this boat trip through an email from booking.com and it didn't disappoint. The three Islands all had slightly different draws and there was some interesting information from the tour guide, although it was quite limited considering how many languages they needed to say each item in. The glass demonstration at Murano was brilliant, although I'd suggest sitting near the front if you can to get a good view. Our boat was split into two groups (one upstairs and one downstairs) so there was enough room per demonstration which helped. There was some amazing pieces in the shop, however I would suggest walking 2 minutes out of the museum towards the coast where there are several more shops with reasonable pricing. Burano was beautiful and the coloured houses were great for photos, although due to the amount of tours arriving at the same time it was difficult to find somewhere to eat and I would suggest going for food first, then wander, or bring some with you. Torcello was also interesting with some great buildings, but the Church's were a good walk from the boat which could be a struggle for some people within the time they give you. Overall well worth the €25 fee, considering that paying for an all day boat ticket alone would cost you that much. Would recommend.",2023-05-08,5,United Kingdom,Helpful,,False,Venice,top1,2023,May

It's the perfect amount of time with an intro and then the Four Seasons. These are very talented musicians and the church is beautiful and right next to San Marco square.

Katrina_L,The actual islands of Murano and Burano are beautiful and are something everyone should experience as a traveller.  Although this tour had hundreds of people on the boat and you did not learn anything about the islands or area really at all.  The third island Torcello is lovely but you had to pay to look inside the churches and having already paid for the tour seemed a bit much.  I just think you could probably do these island either by hiring a water taxi or doing a smaller group tour and have a better experience.,2023-07-21,3,,Helpful,,False,Venice,top1,2023,July

You could see them smiling at one another— they clearly love the music and love bringing it to others. The concert-master and lead violinist would get so into the piece that he would close his eyes, step away from the sheet music, and play from his soul.

Anonymous,"We booked the tour with the expectation that the guide would be a little more present during the course of the day. In reality he only explained some basic notions about the islands that we saw during the trips to Murano, Burano and Torcello (there were no explanations on the return). On the islands it was entirely self-managed. The explanation and demonstration on the island of Murano is interesting. Considering the experience, I recommend using the scheduled vaporettos to reach the islands independently and organizing yourself to participate in a demonstration in Murano (especially because the daily or multi-day vaporetto pass is often already purchased to reach the center or get around the city more easily). In this way, there would be more freedom in deciding travel times (on some islands we would have stayed longer than allowed). If you are thinking of shopping on the island of Murano, we also recommend visiting it last so as to avoid having to spend the whole day with shopping bags. Finally, we think that a visit to Torcello is worth doing if you have the time (and desire) to visit the inside of the buildings on the island (church... note: entrance fee). Although the buildings outside are beautiful, considering the walk to get there it might not be worth it.",2023-08-10,2,,Helpful,a partner or spouse,True,Venice,top1,2023,August

Chelsea_N,"as people have said previous, this tour does get massively booked up, and there is a very tight squeeze onto the huge boat. 
on the boat, i appreciate the tour guide is trying to translate in many different languages, but it is that rushed, that by time you hear the information in your language, shes already gone past half the details so you miss it. 
the glass watching part is fantastic, albeit, they had to squeeze a huge amount of people into a room that isnt adequate to fit that many to watch. 
i felt like the last island of torcello was a bit of a meh sort of visit, i would have much rather had a longer time in burano as there was much more to see and after getting something to eat in burano, theres not much time to do anything else. i feel like the tour would benefit more if they put the time of torcello into burano and got rid of torcello, or if they extended the duration of the tour by maybe an extra hour or two for burano. 
overall was a really good day especially at murano and the time spent in burano, but do feel like the numbers need to be reduced slightly and the times extended :)",2023-09-18,3,,Helpful,,False,Venice,top1,2023,September

The hall swallowed up much of the sound so that the Handel and Bach appetizers seemed to consist of a double bass with a whispery violin on melody.  For me the driving cantabile pulse seemed missing from most of the Vivaldi and we both felt the concertmaster considered he was doing us a favour to let us hear him. One evidence is the way many passages were rushed as if to show how clever the musicians are instead of letting me sing with the tender parts and triumph in the high energy pulses.  From reading other reviews. I see I'm the odd man out.  It was performed in a stunning venue and you'll probably enjoy it.

However, the only form of the 'tour' is conveyed via commentary on the boat towards the islands, which is sometimes hard to hear and follow, since this is done in a few different languages.

Leisure time spent walking alongside the canals viewing the beautifully coloured houses in Burano was really enjoyable. Great stop for lunch here as well.

I chose to do the 6-hour tour but the times inside are managed badly, that is: the first stop which involves going to see how they make glass simply takes 30 minutes and not an hour or so and honestly I would have liked to visit Murano too since we were there. The second stage which included Burano (lunch time) in my opinion should have added more minutes in that stage because now that one goes to have lunch the time is over. Very useless last stage honestly. Not an hour to see Torcello. There is practically nothing to see and if I had known this beforehand I would not have chosen the 6 hour tour. I would also add that we had a hard time finding the ticket office, it is practically located in a small spot. Constructive criticism",2024-02-07,2,,Helpful,,True,Venice,top1,2024,February

Pachelbel's canon, I have never heard it so quickly. Little by little, it accelerated, it accelerated... In addition, the cellist struck a wrong note from the start of his intervention. Well done.

The islands we managed to see were lovely but not happy about how the trip were organised.",2024-03-15,3,United Kingdom,Helpful,family,False,Venice,top1,2024,March
