Gabriel,"Chiar am intrat în muzeu fără să stau la rând, ba chiar cu jumătate de oră înainte de ora programată. A fost mai greu să dau de persoana care să ne introducă în muzeu, nu avea niciun însemn, gen steag alb sau ceva care să facă referire la Italian Pass, așa cum era în descrierea atracției, dar dacă spui tipilor care stau în fața Academiei ca ai rezervare, e ok. Tot ce trebuie să faci este să fii cu câteva minute înainte de ora programată și faci rost de bilet și ești introdus în fața celorlalți. Am venit la atracție în special pentru David de Michelangelo, dar sunt și alte lucruri interesante de văzut aici.",2024-03-07,5,Romania,Helpful,a partner or spouse,True

When we finally found who to get our tickets from, they told us ""go to the red line and you'll be able to walk right in"".

Anonymous,"We only looked into getting the tickets the day before and realized that all were sold out on the official site. So had no choice but to book thru 3rd party. Official entrance fee is only 16eur each, but here we pay a premium (26eur each) and under 18yo should be free but they also charge for kids 6 and above. So value wise it's not great. Pick up was a bit confusing, listed address is incorrect (so don't follow the address listed on the listing) at the entrance there were all sort of people standing around and you had to ask to find the correct company rep. However, it does skip the line, so there's no queue etc which was quite a breeze.",2024-01-07,4,,Helpful,family,False

We meet the ticket holder in front of gallery holding company flag, once we were given our tickets, we stood in the que and waited for time stamp. We walked right in and went thru security.

Korbinian_S,"Karten (Floranz:David) waren leider völlig überteuert. Beim Zeitpunkt war nicht klar, ob man vorher kommen muss (wie bei anderen Diensten), oder wie hier nur pünktlich. Der Treffpunkt war unklar beschrieben, wir mussten uns durchfragen. Die Schlangen für die Zeit-Vorbuchung waren fast genauso lang wie die normalen Ticket-Schlangen. Für 88 Euro (Familie) statt 28 Euro (regulärer Preis), hätte das schon besser organisiert sein können.
