Christophe,"Très bonne organisation Déçu par le concert. En une heure pile, le concert était terminé et pour cause ! Tous les tempi étaient trop rapides. À croire que le 1er violon avait une pizza sur le feu. Ce concert relevait plus d’un exercice de virtuosité de sa part. Le seul instant paisible, reposant, était le 2ème mouvement de l’automne (il ne jouait pas ). Le canon de Pachelbel, je ne l’ai jamais entendu aussi vite. Au fur et à mesure, ça accélérait, ça accélérait… En plus, le violoncelliste plante une fausse note dès le début de son intervention. Bravo. Bref, pas si mal mais on avait envie de leur dire, « hé les gars, respirerez, détendez vous ! ». En tout cas, ce n’était pas apaisant comme concert.",2024-03-02,3,France,Helpful,family,True

Karen_B,"I love Vivaldi's work and I make it a point to go to a Vivaldi Concert every time I visit Venice.  This is the first one I have been to in this particular location and it was excellent.  The musicians are very talented.  Listening to the Four Seasons in Vivaldi's ""church"" was a great experience.  Even my 43 year old son who grudgingly attended with me (not a fan of Classical music) said at the end, ""this was not bad and I even enjoyed it.""  High praise indeed.  I would highly recommend this concert and this venue.",2024-03-01,5,,Helpful,,False

Paula  Inês,"Booked it on the day of the concert (which is amazing tbh), the check-in was super fast however the instructions to pick up the tickets were a bit misleading (it was way simpler than the site made it to be).

Unfortunately the experience was marred by many people holding phones up to film the musicians throughout, and by being sat beside someone coughing, fidgeting, talking (!), and being on their phone throughout event.

Joshua_D,"You enter this beautiful church, are quickly and efficiently checked in and given a program.  They will help you find your seat if necessary.  When the time comes, the orchestra comes out - a hush falls over the crowd. And without an introduction, long speech welcoming you, or any trite intoduction, they start playing.  While we both like Vivaldi, my wife loves Vivaldi's Four Seasons and I think I might have seen a tear or two and a non-stop smile on her face.  The head violinist took a few liberties when it comes to timing, but you were never mad about it. I think it was to showcase his skill.  They spirinkled in some Canon in D and a few other songs that were beautiful as well.  Just a wonderful hour and a great way to start or end an evening.",2023-12-01,5,,Helpful,,False

Ken_M,"For someone who loves the Four Seasons as much as I do, as someone who listened to it every day after school while doing my homework, this was a big disappointment.  The hall swallowed up much of the sound so that the Handel and Bach appetizers seemed to consist of a double bass with a whispery violin on melody.  For me the driving cantabile pulse seemed missing from most of the Vivaldi and we both felt the concertmaster considered he was doing us a favour to let us hear him. One evidence is the way many passages were rushed as if to show how clever the musicians are instead of letting me sing with the tender parts and triumph in the high energy pulses.  From reading other reviews. I see I'm the odd man out.  It was performed in a stunning venue and you'll probably enjoy it.  Remember there are three different ensembles playing the Quattro Stagiones almost every day in Venice.",2023-10-09,2,,Helpful,,False

You could see them smiling at one another— they clearly love the music and love bringing it to others.

Erika_F,"Thoroughly enjoyed the concert, a highlight of our trip, for sure! The extra cost for the front seats was worth it. Our daughters, ages 10 and 7, said it was “amazing” and couldn’t take their eyes off of the violinists’ fingers. We heard Four Seasons in Prague before, but this performance was better. Experiencing the music in the Vivaldi church was so special. Years from now when we recall our first family trip to Venice, I’m sure this will be a memory that comes easily.",2023-07-30,5,,Helpful,,False

Heather_C,"Really wonderful experience. Yes, it's hot - so bring a fan, but don't let it keep you from this if you are interested in hearing Vivaldi's composition in the place it originated. It's the perfect amount of time with an intro and then the Four Seasons. These are very talented musicians and the church is beautiful and right next to San Marco square. You get your seats assigned when you show your Viator voucher, so you might want to go pick up your tickets early, and then get a drink right next to the church (on the water) before you come back for the performance.",2023-07-20,5,,Helpful,,False
Carolyn_h,"This was a lovely concert. About an hour and 15 minutes, which was perfect.

tajinder_s,beautiful concert with so much talent and in a beautiful church. im traveling solo so i just didn’t like how my seat was taken and they didn’t ask anyone to move so i had to sit in a different row where peoples heads were in the way. i feel like if i paid for a seat i should be able to sit there. besides this minor issue i would recommend this concert and get there early so your seat is available! esp if you’re a solo traveler,2023-06-13,5,,Helpful,,False
Amy_T,This was our very first activity in Venice the day we arrived to Italy for the first time. It was AMAZING! If you enjoy classical music or Vivaldi at all you should go! It was six exceptional musicians playing through the Vivaldi seasons in a smaller chapel right on the sea walkway. You have an assigned seat and tickets are right there at will-call for you. I would arrive at least 15 minutes early as chapel was fairly full by then. There are many dining options nearby but more expensive as they are on the water/near St. Mark's. No food/drink is allowed inside. It was enchanting in every way.,2023-06-12,5,,Helpful,,False

The Four Seasons Concert in the Vivaldi Church (Venice) was one of our stops that I would do again and recommend to family/friends visiting Venice! The music was easy to follow and relaxing.

Stella_A,"Firstly, we had terrible trouble trying to depend on Google Maps to get us to the church, because the satellite GPS is slow and did not show us that there were construction works blocking the suggested route.  Once we actilually arrived (after walking about 35 minutes very fast), the staff were most polite and helpful, making us wait (understandably) at the back of the church until there was a break in the music. This gave us a chance to regain our breaths discreetly. Once we had settled in to our seats, the experience was absolutely sensational.  The maestro (Alberto Martin) directed his little group effortlessly and with original interpretation of the well-known music, in a most refreshing and compelling way.  The players are all most accomplished experts, well balanced and harmonious. We really enjoyed it very much indeed, despite our hasty and disorganised arrival. We were treated respectfully and kindly by the staff at the church, whose interior is typically Venetian and beautiful.",2023-04-04,5,,Helpful,,False
