Tiffany_C,"We started our first full day in Florence with this tour in the morning. It was a fantastic way to start off, as it was informative and engaging. Even with a large group, about 30 people, it felt accessible. Our kids said it was their favorite tour out of the ones we did afterwards too. This was a free tour - so it was definitely a steal. A tip was expected at the end, which we didn't mind giving, but it was something we did not originally budget for. If the tour is being offered as free, it should state that tips are expected to compensate the tour guide so as not to catch anyone off guard by the request. Otherwise, this was by far our favorite and we would highly recommend this - just be prepared to tip a minimum of 10 euros per person in your group (we had 5, and only had American dollars on us).

He was incredibly knowledgeable, highly educated, and passionate about sharing his love of city and country. He provided dining and sightseeing recommendations when asked, and described best routes to some of the best views of the city. He also kindly shared how he makes a living as a tour guide and recommended tipping standards. He was friendly, helpful and I felt went above and beyond with his knowledge of the city. He stopped at concrete locations and pointed out valuable tools for navigating and understanding what we were seeing and how to identify what we learned after the tour (e.g., the Medieval map in the center of the old market square, the style of arches on the castles, the color of the building material, a 14th century statue wearing attire in a nod to Roman ancestors).

Debbie, our tour guide, was amazing and so animated - she knows the history of Florence and the impacts of the Medici Family on Tuscany today.  One very important aspect of the tour was the audio support that every attendee receives along with earbuds!  Debbie is attentive and is willing to answer every question presented.  She also offered suggestions for places to eat that were affordable and good.  We have tried two of her suggestions and they were both outstanding.
As a participant of a tour - it is important to follow the guide and enjoy the presentation.  This tour was easy to follow and gave me/us a solid and helpful foundation from the 1300s to the late 1600s.  
The stories and the journey with Debbie was so much fun and so informative - even if history is not your thing!
There was some walking on this tour, but not a lot.  And the tour is not hilly (up and down).  Older folks can do this tour if walking is not a problem!

Tanya_R,We really enjoyed learning more about the Medici family and the Florence renaissance from Camilla (Flora's Walk).  We've been to Florence many times before but were with children so didn't partake in guided tours.  What a difference a great storyteller makes!  Learning more about the human elements and experience really brings the city and its history to life.  A great way to begin a visit to Florence and definitely worth 2 hours of your time.  Price is great as well as it's based on donation and goes direct to the guide - well earned!   A plus were the additional tips about visiting the city that Camilla sent out afterwards.  Highly recommend overall!,2023-04-08,5,,Helpful,,False

Maria_S,"Girare per Firenze e ascoltare Manuel √® stato fondamentale per proseguire la nostra visita della citt√†. Avevamo a disposizione solo due giorni e conoscere la storia dei Medici ci √® servito per comprendere i vari monumenti e guardarli con consapevolezza. Consigliamo questa esperienza e ci sentiamo di suggerire un paio di cose. La prima √® che se prenotate ma non vi recate all'appuntamento sarebbe corretto avvisare la guida (abbiamo aspettato qualcuno inutilmente...perdipi√π non √® moralmente corretto nei confronti di una guida che guadagna in base alle prenotazioni). La seconda √® legata alla prima: √® vero, √® un tour con offerta libera; questo per√≤ non significa approfittare e pagare a fine tour una cifra non consona (basta guardare su internet quanto costino i tour che prevedono un pagamento anticipato per farsi un'idea).
Detto questo, ringraziamo ancora Manuel, il suo racconto ricco di aneddoti che i libri di storia non raccontano, la sua competenza e la sua disponibilit√†. Lo avremmo ascoltato volentieri per altre due ore.

The tour guides are extremely knowledgeable about all things florentine history and also where to find the best olive oil/wine in the city to buy/ship to family as gifts among other things. It is a walking tour, and you walk a lot! But florence is almost all flat so don't worry about going up and down hills.

Anneliza_H,"Manuel was an amazing tour guide and storyteller. So full of passion for his work and his city. As we toured,  I would see bystanders sneaking a listen wishing they were part of this tour as his stories were so captivating and interesting. Another tour guide fell ill so he had to lead an unusually large group of people. What was amazing is that he remembered everyone‚Äôs names in the group despite the size. He also ended the tour by providing everyone his personal list/cheat sheet of recos of where to go, see and experience. He taught us how to get more out the experience by reading the buildings and the details. As we toured other towns the following days, I remembered what I learned on this tour and felt all the more appreciative for this tour.",2022-05-02,5,,Helpful,,False
